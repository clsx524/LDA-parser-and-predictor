Martial Arts Of Shaolin (Chinese: 南北少林; pinyin: Nan bei Shao Lin, aka South North Shaolin, aka Shaolin Temple 3: Martial Arts of Shaolin) is a 1986 Hong Kong martial arts film. It is notable as the only collaboration to date between film director Lau Kar-Leung and actor Jet Li. It's later release on DVD as Dragon Dynasty.
The film is the third part of the successful 'Shaolin' film series which began with the 1982 Shaolin Temple and was followed by Kids From Shaolin (1984). However, although it stars many Mainland actors from either or both predecessor films (Jet Li, Yu Chenghui, Yu Hai, Hu Jianqiang and Huang Qiuyan), Martial Arts Of Shaolin uses a Shaw Brothers Hong Kong production crew, in contrast to the other two films (which are Hong Kong-funded but are shot by a Mainland director with a Mainland crew).
Martial Arts Of Shaolin performed moderately well at the Hong Kong box office, grossing HK $18,106,589.
