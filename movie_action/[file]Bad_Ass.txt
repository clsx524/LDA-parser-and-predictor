Bad Ass is a 2012 American action film written by Elliot Tishman. Directed by Craig Moss, the film stars Danny Trejo, Charles S. Dutton, and Ron Perlman. It is loosely based on the AC Transit Bus fight.
Decorated Vietnam vet Frank Vega (Danny Trejo) returns home only to be shunned by society, leaving him without a job or his high school sweetheart. It's not until forty years later when an incident on a commuter bus, where he protects an elderly black man from a pair of skinheads, makes him a local hero, and he's suddenly celebrated once again. But his good fortune suddenly turns for the worse when his best friend Klondike (Harrison Page) is murdered and the police aren't doing anything about it.
Bad Ass was loosely based on the AC Transit Bus fight, which was filmed by a bystander and became a viral video on YouTube.
Production was completed by May 2011. SC Films picked up sales rights to the film with plans to present it to buyers at the Cannes Film Festival. The film has been sold to Wild Bunch for distribution in Germany and to Pinnacle Films for distribution in Australia. Subsequently distribution arrangements were made with Samuel Goldwyn Films for USA theatrical release on April 13, 2012 as well as Twentieth Century Fox for ancillary rights and international all media distribution.
Reception to the film's premise has been mixed, with some news articles wondering if the film was actually real or a hoax. Vulture's Sarah Benned commented on the preview, saying "This trailer for Bad Ass (loosely based on this viral video) is either a parody, the trailer for a parody, or just an excuse to make Danny Trejo beat people up while wearing a fanny pack. It's your call." Cinema Blend has compared the trailer to Trejo's initially mock-trailer for Machete, saying "This could be a spoof trailer sandwiched in the middle of a Grindhouse sequel. Then again, that worked for Machete, so why couldnâ€™t it kick-start Bad Ass, as well?"
