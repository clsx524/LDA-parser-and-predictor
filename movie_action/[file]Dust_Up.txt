Dust Up is a Canadian reality television series produced by Paperny Entertainment and Prairie Threat Entertainment that aired on History Television. The series follows three crop dusters in Nipawin, Saskatchewan (73-year-old Bud Jardine, his son Brennan Jardine, and rookie pilot Travis Karle) as they compete for work and mount sometimes-perilous crop dusting expeditions. Each plane is outfitted with four cameras to capture the action.
