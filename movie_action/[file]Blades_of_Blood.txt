Blades of Blood (Goo-reu-meul beo-seo-nan dal-cheo-reom 구르믈 버서난 달처럼) is a 2010 South Korean action drama film directed by Lee Joon-ik. The film is based on the graphic novel Like the Moon Escaping from the Clouds.
Actor Hwang Jung-min expressed his difficulty playing a blind character in the film. Hwang went to schools for blind people to observe their movements but stated that "it still wasn’t an easy role to play".
Blades of Blood premiered on April 29, 2010 in Korea. The film had its international premiere at New York Asian Film Festival on July 8, 2010 where it was the festival's closing film. Lee Joon-ik won the Jury Award for Best Director at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal Canada. Blades of Blood was one of six films considered as Korea's submission for the foreign-language Oscar award.
Film Business Asia gave the film a rating of seven out of ten, praising action and characters calling it a "cut above most Korean swordplay dramas." Variety gave the film a mixed review, stating that "political infighting on the eve of a Japanese invasion is told with unnecessarily broad, imagistic strokes that let character-generated conflicts slip between the blades" as well as that "the film easily outdoes numerous gimmicky f/x extravaganzas, explaining its early pickup by several European and Asian distribs."
