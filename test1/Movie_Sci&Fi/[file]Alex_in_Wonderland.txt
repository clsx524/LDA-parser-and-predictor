Alex in Wonderland is a 1970 American comedy-drama film directed by Paul Mazursky, written with his partner Larry Tucker and starring Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn. Sutherland plays Alex Morrison, a director who has made one feature and spends his time in Hollywood pondering what his next will be. Mazursky plays a new-style Hollywood producer in the film, and his daughter Meg Mazursky portrays Amy, one of Morrison's daughters. Noted teacher of improvisational theater Viola Spolin plays Morrison's mother.
At the time, Mazursky himself, who'd just made Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), was in a similar situation. The film also features cameo appearances by Federico Fellini and Jeanne Moreau, and seems to be inspired by their work. In particular, Fellini's 8½ (1963), about a film director who's artistically stuck, is referenced. Moreau sings two songs on the soundtrack, "Le Vrai Scandale" (for which she wrote the words) and "Le Reve Est La."
Young director Alex Morrison who feels compelled to follow his recent box-office hit with another blockbuster. While mulling over this dilemma, the director's mind wanders to his past, his present, and probable future.
A young schoolboy is spirited away to a magical fantasy land after falling asleep in the school library while writing an essay on children's literature in this family friendly dance musical. Alex always thought fairy tales were for girls, though after befriending the White Rabbit, he discovers that the human imagination knows no boundaries. James Ingram, Diane Louie, and Debbie Allen provide the score for a music-filled fantasy inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 75&nbsp;mins
