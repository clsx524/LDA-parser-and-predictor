A young orphan from Kingman, Kansas insists that she is in fact Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz, and receives a visit from some old friends who may just prove her right in this inspirational tale for the entire family. 12 year old Elizabeth (Jordan VanVracken) lives in a Kansas orphanage. Believing herself to be the wide-eyed heroine of L. Frank Baum's most famous book, she longs for the day she will be reunited with her beloved dog Toto, and all of her old friends from the land of Oz. Meanwhile, as the concerned headmistress at the orphanage fears that the young girl is growing delusional, Scarecrow (Jermel Nakia), The Tin Woodman (Orien Richman), and The Cowardly Lion (P. David Miller) realize that their old friend Dorothy is the only one who can save Oz from a dire threat that's sweeping through the land. Boarding a hot air balloon bound for Kansas, Scarecrow and The Tin Woodman seek out Elizabeth and attempt to convince her of her true identity in time to ensure a happy future for the inhabitants of Oz. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All After the Wizard Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
