For many a decade, the Manhattan eatery Le Cirque -- established and run by Chef Sirio Maccioni, the concocter of Pasta Primavera -- reigned as a Valhalla of fine dining for connoisseurs of the gustatory arts, and a Mecca for celebrity watchers. Andrew Rossi's documentary A Table in Heaven captures the establishment at that most tenuous of moments for any restaurant: its transition from one set of owners to the next -- in this case, from Maccioni to his three sons. As Rossi's cameras roll, the director observes father and children debating over how to best meet the needs of celebrity patrons and reel in the most avant-garde chefs while continuing to define culinary trends. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 74&nbsp;mins
