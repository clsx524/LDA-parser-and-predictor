Three friends feign salvation in order to get out of jail with a slap on the wrist, but find their little white lie starting to snowball after they're recruited to take over the local church of a small God-fearing community. Sam (Richard Speight), Jamal (Elijah Rock), and Frankie (Stelio Savante) were just three guys passing through the small town of Rocky Road when one wrong move landed them behind bars. Fortunately for them, Rusty Pickens (Barry Corbin) seems to know everyone in town, and gets them released into his custody. Now all Sam, Jamal, and Frankie must do to maintain their freedom is whip the local church back into shape. But Rusty isn't exactly the fine, upstanding citizen that he's made himself out to be, and now it won't be long before Sam and company summon the courage to stand up to him. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
