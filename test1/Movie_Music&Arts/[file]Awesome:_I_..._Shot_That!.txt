The Beastie Boys let their fans do the shooting as they take the stage of Madison Square Garden for the final date of their "Challah at Your Boy" tour in a concert video that truly puts the viewer right in the middle of all the action. With a mix of fifty DV and Hi-8 cameras distributed to shutter-bug fans and little more instruction than to keep the tapes rolling, director Nathaniel Hornblower and supervising editor Neal Usatin skillfully edit the resulting amateur footage into a kaleidoscopic, rough-edged take on the typically slick, professionally shot concert video. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie GuideSee All Awesome: I ...
