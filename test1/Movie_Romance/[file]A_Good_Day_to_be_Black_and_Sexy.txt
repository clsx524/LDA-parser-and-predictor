Writerdirectoreditor Dennis Dortch explores the subject of sexuality and relationships within the black community in this collection of six vignettes set in Los Angeles and designed to shatter stereotypes about black sexuality. From the woman determined to get hers first to the curious teenager who finds herself in a questionable situation and the boy who becomes stifled by interracial taboos, Dortch's film doesn't shy away from the more controversial aspects of contemporary sexuality. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All A Good Day to be Black and Sexy Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
