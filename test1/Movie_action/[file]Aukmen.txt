A Qatar engineer moves to Thailand and becomes a Muay Thai fighter, only to find that winning in the ring won't be his biggest challenge in this action {\drama] inspired by actual events. Ahmad Al-Sulaiti was a hard working man stuck in a go-nowhere job. Fired by his abusive employer and with no other job prospects, Ahmad travels to Bangkok to try his luck as a fighter. Just when it looks as if his luck has run out, kindly Apidej and his granddaughter Katoon invite Ahmed to train at their traditional Muay Thai fighting camp. Later recruited to fight in an underground match against K-1 champion Kaoklai Kanorasing, the determined foreigner realizes that the rules favor home grown champs over scrappy newcomers. Now if Ahmad can just prove himself to the people who put their trust in him, he'll be on his way to becoming a true champion. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
