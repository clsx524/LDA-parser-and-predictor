To help build anticipation for an outdoor hockey match held New Year's Day on 2011 between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals, the teams agreed to be filmed for the weeks leading up to the drop of the puck. This footage was released as part of a documentary series titled 247. This set contains all of the episodes from that four-part series. ~ Perry Seibert, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 240&nbsp;mins
