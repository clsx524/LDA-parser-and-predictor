The story is of a carjacking four kids caught in the chaos of one night. The story intercuts between the car and the beginning of that day, following the separate stories of each kid - where they come from, who they are and how they all ended up in one car on that fateful night.
Variety gave the film a positive review, noting that it "maintains a brisk pace and generates a satisfying degree of suspense" and that it "boasts strong performances by well-cast up-and-comers".

Four young people are forced into a desperate situation as their paths cross in this independent drama. Carly (Brittany Snow) and Lena (Christian Serratos) are college students and close friends who are in an emotional funk -- Lena is struggling with the aftermath of an unpleasant breakup, while Carly's family wants her to become a lawyer and she's not sure how to stand up for her own ambitions. Their problems suddenly seem trivial when they're carjacked by Kevin (J. Michael Trautmann) and Dre (Evan Ross). Kevin, the product of an abusive upbringing, is emotionally unstable and wants to join a local youth gang; Dre, who comes from a crime-ridden neighborhood, is smart and ambitious, but he's too loyal to his friend to let him go out alone. When the carjacking goes wrong and someone gets shot, a tense negotiation takes place as everyone tries to keep the situation under control before the law steps in or someone dies. 96 Minutes was the first feature film from writer and director Aimee Lagos. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All 96 Minutes Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
