A Lonely Place to Die is a 2011 thriller film directed by Julian Gilbey and based on a screenplay from Will Gilbey and Julian Gilbey. It stars Melissa George, Ed Speleers, Karel Roden, Eamonn Walker, Sean Harris and Kate Magowan.
A group of five mountaineers are hiking and climbing in the Scottish Highlands when they discover a young Serbian girl buried alive in a small chamber in the wilderness. They face dangerous terrain and become caught up in a terrifying game of cat and mouse with the kidnappers as they try to get the girl to safety.
Shooting began on 13 May 2010 in Scotland under the working title The Grave at Angel's Peak. Julian Gilbey shot the film from the screenplay "The Long Weekend" by Will Gilbey. The film is produced by Carnaby International, the studio behind Doghouse. Franka Potente was originally cast for the role as Alison and was later replaced by Melissa George.
In April 2011, the film had its world premiere at the Actionfest Film Festival in Asheville, North Carolina USA where it was awarded 'Best Film' and 'Best Director'.
After considerable interest at the Cannes film market in May 2011, Kaleidoscope Entertainment picked up the UK rights to release the film. It will be their widest release to date.
The film will have its UK premiere on August 29 where it will be the closing film of Frightfest. It will be released in UK cinemas shortly after on September 7. It is set for release in North America in November, following a screening at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival on October 24, 2011.
