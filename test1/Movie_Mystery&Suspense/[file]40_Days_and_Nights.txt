40 Days and Nights is a 2012 disaster film by The Asylum, directed by Peter Geiger and starring Monica Keena and Alex Carter. It is a modern take on Noah's Ark and the Genesis flood narrative.
When a massive tectonic shift triggers a tsunami capable of swallowing whole continents, the military creates an ark capable of holding only 50,000 people and the DNA of every species possible while the storm consumes most of the world.
As an apocalyptic storm spreads plunges the planet into chaos, the public clamors for a coveted spot on a massive military ark, and a devoted microbiologist attempts to salvage the DNA of species that are doomed to extinction. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All 40 Days and Nights Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
