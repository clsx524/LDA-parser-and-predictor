Apache Rose is a 1947 American film directed by William Witney and starring Roy Rogers. It was the first Roy Rogers Western shot in the Trucolor process though most copies on DVD are in monochrome.
Apache Rose is a "typical" Roy Rogers-Dale Evans musical western: few surprises, but plenty of entertainment value. Rogers plays an oil man who hopes to get drilling rights to an old Spanish settlement in California. The villains plot to grab up the land from themselves, exploiting a handful of highly suspect IOU's for that purpose. Much of the plot hinges on a gambling boat owned by Billie Colby (Dale Evans), a setting which offers plenty of opportunity for a steady stream of musical numbers. A tense, action-filled climax caps this delightful diversion. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
