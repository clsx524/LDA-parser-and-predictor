An Eye for an Eye is a 1966 Western film directed by Michael D. Moore. The film is about two bounty hunters (Robert Lansing, Patrick Wayne) who team up to track and take down another man.
Talion is the alternate title for the blood-splattered western An Eye for an Eye. You know that the filmmakers aren't kidding around when, in the very first scene, outlaw Slim Pickens puts a bullet into a squalling baby! Robert Lansing plays Talion, a homesteader who, after his ranch is burned to the ground and his wife and child are murdered, hires bounty hunter Pat Wayne to track down the killers. The men are forced to rely upon each other when Lansing's gun hand is shattered in a shoot out and Wayne is blinded during a confrontation with the outlaws. Lansing and Wayne combine into one single, unstoppable killing machine. Talion was co-scripted by Bing Russell, father of film star Kurt Russell. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
