Against a Crooked Sky is a 1975 American Western film directed by Earl Bellamy and starring Richard Boone, Stewart Petersen, and Henry Wilcoxon.
The eldest daughter of a pioneer family is kidnapped by a mysterious Indian tribe and the eldest son pursues. In order to win back his sister's freedom, he must sacrifice his own life by passing the test of "Crooked Sky" and shield his sister from an executioner's arrow. Along the way, he recruits a broken down, drunk prospector to help him track down the unknown tribe and rescue his sister.
Against a Crooked Sky is a remake of John Ford's landmark western The Searchers. Richard Boone appears in the John Wayne role, playing an ageing trapper obsessed with rescuing a white girl from her Indian captors. Another movie veteran, Henry Wilcoxon, is the ruthless yet honorable Indian chief. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
