The First Easter Rabbit is a 1976 animated Easter special, seen on NBC and later CBS. Created by Rankin/Bass, it tells the story of the Easter Bunny's origin and is loosely based on The Velveteen Rabbit, a children's book by Margery Williams. Burl Ives did the narration of this special which also featured the song "Easter Parade".
The film tells the story of "Stuffy", a plush rabbit that a little girl receives as a Christmas present, but when the little girl becomes sick with Scarlet Fever, her possessions have to be burned to disinfect the playroom. Stuffy is rescued by a fairy, who brings him to life and sends him to a place at the North Pole called Easter Valley. An ice creature called Zero wants to freeze the valley and make it like the rest of the pole, and Stuffy must become the Easter Bunny in order to stop him.
