Julian Berniers returns from Illinois with his young bride Lily Prine to the family in New Orleans. His spinster sisters Carrie and Anna welcome the couple, who arrive with expensive gifts. The sisters hope Julian will help with their expenses, and he tells them that while his profitable factory went out of business, he did manage to save money.
It turns out that Julian pulled off a real estate deal. Carrie is obsessed with her brother. Her jealousy of Lily pushes her to discover the land deal for herself and she does everything she can to wreck their marriage.
A mysterious attic packed with long-forgotten items of decades gone by serves as the starting point for this imaginative and visually dynamic fantasy from Czech director Jiri Barta and screenwriter Edgar Dutka. Done with a combination of live action and stop-motion animation, the tale concerns Buttercup, a beautiful doll who falls into the clutches of the Plaster Head, ruler of the Land of Evil. In response, an army of abandoned toys who hold Buttercup dear in their hearts stage a valiant rescue effort. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviSee All Toys in the Attic Trailers and ClipsComplete Cast of Toys in the AtticBoris Hybner - MuchaJoan Cusack - Madam Curie (English Version)Forest Whitaker - Mucha (English Version)Cary Elwes - Sir Handsome (English VersionVivian Schilling - Buttercup (English Version)Director(s):Jiri BartaWriter(s):Edgar Dutka,&nbsp;Jiri BartaProducer(s):Vivian Schilling,&nbsp;Milos Smidmajer
