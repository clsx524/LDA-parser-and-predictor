Venezuelan hit man Parca the Reaper takes over a Caracas hospital in the middle of a medical strike, and holds the staff hostage in a desperate attempt to save his girlfriend's life. Meanwhile, as police surround the building and the media circus gets underway, Parca becomes a folk hero by agreeing to give up one hostage for each new patient admitted. But when tensions in the hospital spill out into the streets, a heroic gesture has unexpected consequences. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 102&nbsp;mins
