Several nemeses are hot on their trail, including a pair of ruthless killers (Ng, Yu Nan) and a cadre of lawmen headed by Detective Leopard (Duan Yihong). Early on, the officers manage to capture Zhang and Sun and take them to their camp, but the assassins soon appear as well, which forces Zhang to assume a heroic role in the presence of his captors, and ignites a series of surprising and explosive reversals. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 118&nbsp;mins
