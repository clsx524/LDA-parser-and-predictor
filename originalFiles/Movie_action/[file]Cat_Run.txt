A wannabe chef and an unrepentant womanizer team up to start a detective agency, and quickly realize they've gotten in over their heads when their first job lands them smack in the middle of a massive government conspiracy. Anthony and his best friend, Julian, have yet to live up to their full potential. When Anthony realizes he's never going to become a five-star chef and Julian grows weary of playing the constant lothario, the two lifelong pals turn to sleuthing to make ends meet. Their first client is a smoldering top-dollar escort with evidence of a high-profile cover-up. At first they do their best to keep control of the situation, but when a shady U.S. senator comes knocking, the mob shows up guns blazing, and a most unusual assassin gets them locked in her sights, the only way to survive is to run like the devil and never look back. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Cat Run Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 107&nbsp;mins
