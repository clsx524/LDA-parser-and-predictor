Four friends set out on an everyday errand and end up in a fight for their lives when they find the body of a dead hooker in the trunk of their car.
Four friends race to get rid of the dead hooker discovered decomposing in their trunk, and learn that disposing of a dead body isn't nearly as easy as it looks on TV. A tough-talking babe, her nerdy sister, their God-fearing friend, and a junkie rocker are preparing for another typical day when they make a grim discovery. Someone has murdered a hooker and stuffed her in their trunk. But who did it, and why? As the quarreling foursome search for a place to dump the deceased streetwalker, the police close in and the freaks come out of the word work. Meanwhile, a serial killer is on the loose, and an eccentric cowboy pimp has some pretty big plans for the troublesome cadaver. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Dead Hooker in a Trunk Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
