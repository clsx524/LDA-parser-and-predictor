Tales of an Ancient Empire is a 2010 fantasy film, starring Kevin Sorbo, Whitney Able, Victoria Maurette, and Lee Horsley, directed by Albert Pyun. It is the sequel to Pyun's directorial debut, The Sword and the Sorcerer.
Queen Ma’at (Jennifer Siebel Newsom) finds her kingdom of Abelar under attack when treasure seekers accidentally open the tomb of vampire queen Xia (Whitney Able). The Queen sends her half-sister, Princess Tanis (Melissa Ordway), to the outlaw city of Douras to find her real father (Michael Paré) so he can save the kingdom. Meanwhile, servant girl Kara (Victoria Maurette) - who shares the same father as Tanis, but her mother is Xia - discovers her true nature as a vampire and begins hunting Tanis. Once in Douras, the Princess finds her half-brother Aedan (Kevin Sorbo) and convinces him to help her. Together they locate half-sister Malia (Sarah Ann Schultz), half-sister Rajan (Janelle Giumarra) and her daughter Alana (Inbar Lavi). With this small group they plan to stop the vampire queen Xia before it is too late.
