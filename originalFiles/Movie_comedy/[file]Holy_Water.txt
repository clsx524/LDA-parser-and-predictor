Barring perhaps the typical quaintness of the average Irish burg, Killcoulin's Leap doesn't have much to offer today's young bachelor. Four pals who live there feel their prime years escaping them but are already almost resigned to accepting the town's severely disproportionate number of women, its less-than-thriving economy, and the small thrills of performing music for the elderly patrons of the local pub. But when an acquaintance manages to leave Killcoulin's Leap and make something himself, the boys get inspired to find a way to scrape together some cash and follow suit. Linda Hamilton and Tommy "Tiny" Lister co-star in this droll comedy. ~ Jonathan Frey, RoviSee All Holy Water Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
