Fatso is a 2008 Norwegian film directed and co-written by Arild Fr√∂hlich.
Obsessed with women but still a virgin, an overweight loner named Rino keeps himself going with porn and his own bizarrely erotic comic stories. Suddenly, his lonely life is transformed by his new housemate, the beautiful and very sexual Malin.
The film won the Best Director award at the 2009 Amanda Awards.
Not to be confused with the 1980 Anne Bancroft-Dom DeLuise farce of the same name, this raunchy Finnish sex comedy stars Nils Jorgen Kaalstad as Rino Hanssen, a virginal, agoraphobic porn addict who still lives with his father at age 30 - and whose only friend is a hateful, asthmatic loser named Filip (Kyrre Hellum). Circumstances change somewhat when Rino's dad opts to rent one of the rooms in his apartment to a beautiful, free-spirited young girl named Malin - so free-spirited, in fact, that she finds meaning through constant sex and wild living. One step at a time, Rino finds himself drawn out of his shell and into a world he has long sought to avoid; fears of failure and rejection linger, however, making this transition an extremely challenging and frightening one for Rino. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
