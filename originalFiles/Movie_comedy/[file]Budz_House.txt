A pot-smoking California slacker and his pals stumble across a local dealer's massive stash, and inadvertently create a powerful new strain of "superweed" while incurring the wrath of some ruthless local gangsters. Bud Howard (Wesley Jonathan) just can't seem to get out of his mother's home. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that he spends all of his time smoking weed and reading comics with his friends -- none of whom are exactly self-motivated. When Bud and his pals happen across a cache of primo buds, they can't believe their good fortune. But this stash is spoken for, and the owner isn't about to let it go without a fight. Squirreling the weed away beneath his porch, Bud gets the shock of his life when a plumbing mishap miraculously fertilizes the plants and creates a revolutionary strain that gets the whole neighborhood buzzing. But as the cash starts rolling in, a local gang leader decides to let them know who's really in charge of the local supply. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Budz House Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 76&nbsp;mins
