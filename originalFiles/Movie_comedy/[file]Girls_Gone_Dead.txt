A wild beach party becomes a nightmare bloodbath when a homicidal maniac shows up with time to kill in this splatter comedy with boobs galore. It's Spring Break, and sexy coed Rebecca has just returned home to have some fun in the sun with her old friends from the cheerleading squad. As the girls settle in to their posh Manatee Creek beach house, a video crew specializing in candid footage of naked coeds comes under attack from a psycho wielding a war-hammer in nearby Daytona Beach. Meanwhile, Rebecca and her friends throw the ultimate summer bash. But as the beats start bumping and the booze begins to flow, the same maniac who just carved up half of Daytona Beach shows up with a serious axe to grind. Jerry Lawler, Ron Jeremy, Katie Peterson, Linnea Quigley, Sal the Stockbroker, and Beetlejuice star. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 105&nbsp;mins
