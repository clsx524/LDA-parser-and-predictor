Critically ill, eccentric Jimmy (Matt D'Elia) makes a complete break from reality upon learning that his roommate James (Brendan Fletcher) is about to start a new job. Jimmy and James are not just roommates, but best friends as well. They share a trendy loft in downtown Los Angeles, and frivolously pass the days away drinking, doing drugs, having one-night stands, and playing board games. For Jimmy, it's the perfect way of life. But James craves structure, and in the morning he will start a new job. To Jimmy, it's the ultimate betrayal. Now, as the two close-knit roommates enter into a hysterical battle of wills while sharing their last day of freedom in the company of two beautiful women (Mircea Monroe and Angela Sarafyan), Jimmy becomes swept up in a complex vortex of emotions that push him ever closer to the brink of total insanity. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All American Animal Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
