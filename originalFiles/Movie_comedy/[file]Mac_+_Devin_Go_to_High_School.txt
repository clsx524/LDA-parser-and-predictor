A 15th year high school senior teams up with the current class valedictorian for a crucial chemistry project, and together they help each other make the grades to graduate in this high-grade pot comedy starring legendary rapper Snoop Dogg. Mac (Dogg) has been dealing weed at N. Hale High for over a decade. Unfortunately his sky high antics have kept his diploma well out of reach. If he doesn't graduate soon, he'll never hook up with the leggy substitute who tempts him in the hallway. Meanwhile, Mac's egghead classmate Devin (Wiz Khalifa) has never blazed up in his whole life. He's in top running for a big scholarship, but he needs to earn straight 'A's to get it. Perhaps with the guidance of their nefarious math teacher (Mike Epps), a little assistance from an unhinged classmate (Andy Milonakis), and a closet full of California kush, Mac will finally graduate, and Devin will get the earn his coveted scholarship while learning to cut loose and have a little fun in the process. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 76&nbsp;mins
