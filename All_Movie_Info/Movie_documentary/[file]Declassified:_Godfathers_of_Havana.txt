In the years immediately prior to Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution, which put him in power in February 1959, the country functioned not simply as a gold coast of the American elite, but as a seemingly limitless source of income for the Mafia. As a result, Castro booted out both the mob and the Batista government when his tanks rolled into Havana. This program from cable's History Channel explores Cuba during the pre-Castro years. It explains how the mob's involvement in the country began during the Prohibition Era of the 1920s, how the country evolved into a focal point of narcotics trafficking, and how the Mafia eventually set up a hedonistic Cuban paradise surrounding it. This expos√© draws heavily on archival materials and interviews with historians who provide an inside perspective. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 47&nbsp;mins
