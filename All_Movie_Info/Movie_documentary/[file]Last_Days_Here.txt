If you're obsessive fan of doom metal, there's a good chance you've heard of Pentagram, a band whose fusion of hard rock, psychedelia and Black Sabbath-style guitar thunder has earned them a passionate cult following, particularly for their hard-to-find 1970s recordings, though they've never approached anything close to mainstream popularity. After years of only sporadic activity, Bobby Liebling, Pentagram's lead singer, principal songwriter and sole constant member through dozens of lineup changes, was approached by Sean "Pellet" Pelletier, a longtime fan who offered to become the group's manager and help put them back on track. That turned out to be a much bigger task than most folks would be willing to take on -- Liebling was living in his parents basement at the time, hooked on hard drugs and emotionally battered by years of depression and disappointment. Filmmakers Don Argott and Demian Fenton became witnesses as Pelletier struggled to help Liebling restart his career and his life, and Last Days Here is a documentary that examines the difficult friendship between the two men as well as the long road back to the stage for Liebling and Pentagram. Last Days Here received its word premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Last Days Here Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
