Convention wisdom has it that parents are usually not the hippest people on Earth, and most kids will tell you their dad is not the coolest guy in town. But what if your dad happens to play in a punk rock band? As the firebrand musicians behind some of California's best-known punk bands get older, many have found themselves settling into long-term relationships and becoming parental authority figures while still making music to support themselves. Filmmaker Andrea Blaugrund Nevins explores the lives of a handful of punk rock dads in the documentary The Other F Word (meaning "fatherhood"), in which some guys balance their rebellious nature against the responsibility of looking after their kids, while others leave the fiery side of their nature out on the road and behave like solid citizens at home. Several also speak of the dysfunctional upbringing that fueled their adolescent anger and makes them strive to be better, more caring fathers to their own kids. The Other F Word includes interviews with Jim Lindberg of Pennywise, Lars Fredrickson of Rancid, Fat Mike of NOFX, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Duane Peters of U.S. Bombs, Mark Hoppus of blink-182, Ron Reyes of Black Flag, and many more. The Other F Word received its world premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All The Other F Word Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 99&nbsp;mins
