Filmmakers Mark and Lindsay Goffman train the spotlight on five ventriloquists who have devoted their lives to making audiences laugh with the help of some truly colorful friends. When withdrawn 13-year-old Dylan finds his voice in the form of a flippant black puppet named Reggie, his father just wishes he would put down the doll and play football. Meanwhile, former beauty queen Kim keeps schoolkids in stitches while seeking a job on a cruise ship, veteran cruise-ship performer Dan strives to stay in his wife's good graces, Terry makes a play for the top prize on America's Got Talent, black sheep Wilma brings smiles to senior citizens and Walmart shoppers, and a visit to the annual Vent Haven convention in Ft. Mitchell, KY, finds ventriloquists from all around the world converging to exchange jokes and bond through puppetry. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Dumbstruck Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 84&nbsp;mins
