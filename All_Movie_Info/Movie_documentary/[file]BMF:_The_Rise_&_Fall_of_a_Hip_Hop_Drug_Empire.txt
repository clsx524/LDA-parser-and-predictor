Follow the DEA, the FBI, and the crack drug task force known as the HIDTA during their intense, 15-year-long investigation of the Black Mafia Family (aka BMF), a group of drug traffickers who netted nearly $300 million by transporting cocaine from Atlanta to Los Angeles. With a legitimate company dubbed BMF Entertainment serving as the front for their criminal activities, the Black Mafia Family rose to the height of power in the hip-hop community before authorities brought the entire empire crumbling to the ground. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 63&nbsp;mins
