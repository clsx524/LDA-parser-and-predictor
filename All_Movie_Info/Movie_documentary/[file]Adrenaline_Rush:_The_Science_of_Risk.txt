The thrill of danger and the heady charge of the unexpected are both examined and reproduced in this documentary. Filmmaker Marc Fafard explores the human biology behind risk-taking -- why it gives some people such a powerful physical lift, and why the human mind and body craves danger. In addition, Fafard presents an up-close look at two of the most dangerous and exciting human pastimes, parachuting and base-jumping. A professional jumper leaps from a 1,300-meter cliff in Norway with a camera in tow to give viewers an idea of how it looks and feels, while parachuting veterans Adrian Nicholas and Katarina Ollikainen face a new challenge as they attempt to recreate Leonardo da Vinci's pioneering 1485 parachute design and see if it works in the 21st century. Adrenaline Rush: The Science of Risk was shot and initially exhibited in the IMAX high-definition film format. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Adrenaline Rush: The Science of Risk Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 37&nbsp;mins
