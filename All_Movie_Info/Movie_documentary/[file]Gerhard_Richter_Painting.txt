One of the giants of contemporary art offers a look into his creative process and working methods in this documentary. Born in Germany in 1932, Gerhard Richter was a child of World War II, spending his early years in Dresden before it was destroyed, and he began studying art in 1947. By the late 1950s, Richter was regularly exhibiting his work, and he earned a reputation for both realistic and abstract paintings that sometimes incorporated photography into their images. Richter is considered one of the world's most respected artists, and Gerhard Richter Painting offers a look at the artist at work in his studio. Filmmaker Corinna Belz focuses on Richter's technique (using modified squeegees as well as brushes) and his routine in the studio, allowing the artist and his work to speak for themselves. The film also presents a profile of the Richter's history via rare interviews and newsreel footage, as well as following him as he prepares for an exhibit of his new work, taking care to see that the paintings are presented to their best advantage. Gerhard Richter Painting was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
