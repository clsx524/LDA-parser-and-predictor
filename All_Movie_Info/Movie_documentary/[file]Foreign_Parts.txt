Embark on a journey into a community where one man's trash is truly another man's treasure as filmmakers J.P. Sniadecki and Verena Paravel explore a side of Queens, New York that most people never see. Take a look behind Citi Field and you'll see Willets Point, an industrial stretch of urban blight where chop shops and scrap yards thrive. If you're having trouble tracking down a part that could keep your car running, you're bound to find it amidst the heaps of rusted out metal that seem to stretch for miles. And if you're especially good at salvaging those parts, you can earn a decent living by selling them for a pretty penny. But as the city eyes the area for redevelopment, the folks who survive on the scraps find their livelihoods at stake, and their futures looking grim. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
