Having previously documented his relationship with his own father in the 2005 film 51 Birch Street, filmmaker Doug Block turns his lens on his teenage daughter, Lucy, as she prepares to depart for college and begin a new chapter in her life. Throughout Lucy's childhood, Block would speak frequently with his daughter on camera. Distraught at the thought of no longer living under the same roof as his beloved daughter, the probing father captures a pivotal moment of transition in his family's history. The filmmaker becomes the subject, however, when his wife weighs in with her own opinions on why he's having such a difficult time letting go. Later, when Lucy leaves and the house turns quiet, Block's wife succumbs to serious depression as she attempts to adjust to life in an empty nest. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Kids Grow Up Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
