Larry Linkogle became fascinated with motorcycles when he was a boy and starting riding in professional motocross events when he was just 15. But it didn't take long for Linkogle to become disenchanted with the status quo of motocross, and with the help of a handful of friends he quit the traditional motocross circuit and created something wilder and more radical -- freestyle motocross, which combined the acrobatics of surfing and skateboarding with the speed and power of motorcycles. Linkogle quickly became a star in the sport he devised, but he also learned first hand about its dangers -- a bad fall cost him his spleen, and when he was hired to do motorcycle stunts for the movie XXX, he collided with a helicopter blade that penetrated through his skull into the frontal lobe of his brain. Remarkably, Linkogle survived, but the many rounds of surgery and medical treatments left him with an addiction to painkillers that threatened to finish him off. Filmmaker Adam Barker offers a no-hold-barred portrait of a rebel determined to follow his own path whatever the cost in the documentary Mind of the Demon: The Larry Linkogle Story, which includes extensive interviews with Linkogle and his compatriots, as well as footage of him in action. Narrated by Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead, Mind of the Demon was an official selection at the 2010 Slamdance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Mind of the Demon: The Larry Linkogle Story Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 63&nbsp;mins
