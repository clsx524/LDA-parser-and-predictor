Executive produced by Major League Baseball manager Bobby Valentine, this documentary examines the lives of two 15-year-old Dominican baseball prospects and details how Major League squads find raw talent in that rich baseball culture. These two players are approaching a momentous milestone, because when they turn 16 they are able to sign with an American ball club. ~ Perry Seibert, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 77&nbsp;mins
