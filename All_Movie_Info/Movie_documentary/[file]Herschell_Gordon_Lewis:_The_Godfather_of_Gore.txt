Explore the career of the filmmaker responsible for inventing the modern gore film in this documentary featuring interviews with such ardent fans and followers as Pink Flamingoes director John Waters and famed drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs. In the beginning, Hershell Gordon Lewis titillated moviegoers with "Nudie Cuties" -- films which featured pretty young women in various states of undress. His career took a decidedly gruesome turn, however, when he unleashed Blood Feast on unsuspecting grindhouse audiences in 1963. A film that reveled in viscera, Blood Feast pushed the boundaries of gore in a manner that was positively shocking for the time. And Lewis was only getting started; in the years that followed he continued to shock moviegoers with such unapologetically repulsive horror films as Two Thousand Maniacs!, The Gruesome Twosome, and The Wizard of Gore. In this film, movie fans get the unique opportunity to explore one of the most fascinating - and morbid -- chapters in the history of cinema. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 106&nbsp;mins
