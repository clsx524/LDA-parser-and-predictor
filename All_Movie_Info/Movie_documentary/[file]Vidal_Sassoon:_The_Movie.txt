Vidal Sassoon is the world's best-known hairdresser, and one who radically changed the way many people thought about hair styling when he rose to fame in the 1960s. But Sassoon had already lived a remarkable and adventurous life before his geometric "wash and wear" hair styles became all the rage in Swinging London. Born in England to Jewish parents, he was part of a British anti-fascist group called the 43 Group, who battled organized anti-Semitism in the wake of World War II, and when his family relocated to Israel, he fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as part of the Israeli Defense Force. In the 1950s, Sassoon returned to England and began pursuing a career cutting women's hair. Within a decade, his Bond Street salon would become a sensation, and after creating distinctive styles for such stars as Mia Farrow and Nancy Kwan, he became the most famous and influential man in his field. As his shop turned into a franchise and he launched a successful line of hair-care products, Sassoon proved he was a shrewd businessman as well as an artist, but despite finding fame and wealth his life has been marked by both triumph and tragedy. Filmmaker Craig Teper offers a look into the public and private life of a man who "changed the world with a pair of scissors" in the documentary Vidal Sassoon: The Movie. Featuring exclusive interviews with Mary Quant, Michael Gordon, and William Claxton as well as Sassoon and his family, Vidal Sassoon: The Movie received its world premiere at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Vidal Sassoon: The Movie Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 93&nbsp;mins
