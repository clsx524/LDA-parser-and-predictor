Atlanta thug Curtis Snow steals a video camera from a group of unsuspecting college kids, and documents his brutal crime spree while fleeing from a vengeful drug dealer who wants him dead. Curtis hustles on the streets of Atlanta to provide for his baby mama and feed their two year old son. When a group of college students drive up looking for drugs, Curtis jacks their camera and starts recording. Meanwhile, as Curtis flees from the cops and raises hell, a ruthless drug dealer he once scammed shows up determined to settle the score. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 79&nbsp;mins
