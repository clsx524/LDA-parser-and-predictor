The controversial U.S. Afghanistan War escalated to a peak on February 13, 2010. Beginning that morning, an American-led coalition undertook the single biggest and most ambitious effort since the inception of the entire conflict. The focal point was Marjah, a Taliban stronghold located at the southern end of the country. The USMC troops pursued four goals: retain all seized ground, transfer control to Afghan security, end Taliban control, and rebuild Afghani infrastructure and government. At the center of it all was the First Battalion of the Bravo Company, 6th Marines, led by the heroic Captain Ryan Sparks. In this gripping film, journalist Ben Anderson follows the counterinsurgency mission, as the 272 Marines are flown in via plane and dropped into the center of Marjah. The events that follow are as grueling and cathartic as they are unforgettable. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviDirector(s):Anthony WonkeWriter(s):Ben AndersonProducer(s):Ben AndersonCategories:DocumentaryLooking for special editions of The Battle for Marjah?See All Versions
