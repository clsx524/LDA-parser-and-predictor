The Ambassador is a 2011 Danish documentary film created and directed by Danish filmmaker and journalist Mads Brugger. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.
Mads Brugger goes undercover as the Liberian diplomat and businessman Mr. Cortzen with the object of building a match factory in Central African Republic; in reality he is uncovering corruption linked to diplomatic title brokerage and blood diamonds.
As a result of the movie's controversial themes, the Liberian government threatened legal action against Brugger. The Dutch businessman Willem Tijssen, who according to the movie brokered the diplomatic title, unsuccessfully filed an injunction to stop screening of the film at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam. According to Danish media, Willem Tijssen is pursuing legal actions in Denmark, for having been filmed with a hidden camera.
The film was well received by critics and currently holds a 76% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes with Kyle Smith of the New York Post calling it, "a stunning, funny, and vital piece of guerilla cinema."
Gonzo filmmaker Mads Brügger poses as a wealthy European-African consul in order to expose corruption and profiteering in the Central African Republic in this audacious hidden-camera documentary. Ostensibly traveling to the landlocked African country to open a match factory, Brügger delves into the dangerous world of blood diamond smuggling while revealing the treacherous greed of obscenely rich white businessmen who make a killing through the misery and suffering of the impoverished, defenseless masses. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Ambassador Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 93&nbsp;mins
