Cherry Tree Lane is a 2010 British urban dramatic real-time horror-thriller film, written and directed by Paul Andrew Williams.
The film tells the story of a middle-aged suburban couple who are terrorised in their home by a group of teenagers who plan to kill their son who has grassed-up one of their friends.
Based on a specially written script template, the film was made for Steel Mill Pictures. The director Paul Andrew Williams began the shooting of the psychological thriller on 16 July 2009 in North London. Ken Marshall produced the film for UK Film Council and Steel Mill Pictures.
The film premiered on 23 June 2010 as part of the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2010. Cherry Tree Lane is part of the Film4 Frightfest on 29 August 2010. Metrodome Distribution holds the rights for the sales in England.
The film received positive reviews from critics. The Film Blogger dubbed it a “moderately tense thriller”, that was “accentuated by a well-developed class commentary and some solid performances”.
The film’s name is an ironic reminder of the address of the idealised suburban Banks family in the popular 1964 film Mary Poppins.
