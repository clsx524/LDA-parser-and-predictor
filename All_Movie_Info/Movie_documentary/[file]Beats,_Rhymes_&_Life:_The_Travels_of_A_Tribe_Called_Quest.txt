Actor Michael Rapaport turns documentary filmmaker with this look at the turbulent career of progressive New York hip-hop outfit A Tribe Called Quest. Interviews with such fans and contemporaries as the Beastie Boys, De La Soul, Ludacris, Kanye West, and Common reveal how the group helped steer collective hip-hop consciousness in an exciting new direction by combining divergent styles and penning positive lyrics before deciding to call it quits back in 1998. Additional interviews with members Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, and Phife Dawg during their 2008 reunion tour offer added insight into their glory days as hip-hop pioneers, and life after A Tribe Called Quest. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
