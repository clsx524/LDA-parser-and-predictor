A remarkable dog helps to solve a supernatural mystery and locate a missing cat in this playful family-oriented comedy from the people who brought you The Dog Who Saved Christmas. Halloween is on the horizon, and the Bannister's have just moved into their new home. As George (Gary Valentine) and Zeus (voice of Joey Lawrence) investigate a particularly suspicious neighbor (Lance Henriksen), they encounter a terrifying canine (voice of Mayim Bialik) and stumble across an old dark house. Just when it looks like they've gotten themselves into a tight jam, however, the sleuthing pair find unlikely allies in the form of two incompetent burglars (Dean Cain and Joey "Coco" Diaz) with a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And they'll need all the help they can get, because a local cat has gone missing, and no one seems to have any idea where it has disappeared to. Co-starring Curtis Armstrong and Elisa Donovan. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
