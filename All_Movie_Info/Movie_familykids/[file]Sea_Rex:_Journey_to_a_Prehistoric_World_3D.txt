Embark on an unforgettable journey through the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods and swim with creatures that have been extinct for millions of years in this film that explores our past in ways we've never imagined. Long before the Tyrannosaurus Rex roamed the land, enormous sea creatures like the Shonisaurus called the ocean their home. Now, thanks to computer-generated imagery and IMAX technology, we can swim alongside these majestic beasts and experience sights that no human has ever witnessed. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 58&nbsp;mins
