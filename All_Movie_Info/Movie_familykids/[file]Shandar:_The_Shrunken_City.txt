Two young explorers discover a miniature city encapsulated in a glass globe, and fight to protect it from otherworldly invaders in this fantasy adventure for the entire family. For hundreds of years, the tiny city of Shandar has sat dormant underground. But when an excavation project brings Shandar to the surface, George and Lori attempt to get a closer look. Suddenly, the dormant city has sprung to life. But a team of mysterious creatures from another dimension seem poised to destroy it forever. Meanwhile, after being magically transported into Shandar, George and Lori strike up a friendship with kindly caretaker Prime. Now, unless Shandar regains power, it will soon expand to its original size. Should that happen, it would mean complete destruction of not only Shandar, but George and Lori's home as well. With their time quickly running out, the two kids embark on a quest to save the tiny city. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 85&nbsp;mins
