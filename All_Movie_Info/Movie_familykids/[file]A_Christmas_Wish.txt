The Great Rupert, is a 1950 comedy family film, produced by George Pal, directed by Irving Pichel and starring Jimmy Durante, Tom Drake and Terry Moore. It is based on a story, written by Ted Allan, which has also been published as a children's book under the title "Willie the Squowse".
The story revolves around a little animated squirrel who, with lots of charm, accidentally helps two economically distressed families overcome their obstacles.
George Pal's stop-motion animation used in creating the illusion of a dancing squirrel (Rupert) was so realistic that he received many inquiries as to where he located a trained squirrel.
In 1999, Arnold Leibovit Entertainment re-released the film on DVD.
In 2003, 20th Century Fox and Legend Films revived the (now) public domain film with a colorized special edition of the film, under the title A Christmas Wish. For that release, Terry Moore provided an audio commentary track.

A down-on-her-luck mom (Kristy Swanson) finds herself penniless and homeless just before Christmas when her husband leaves her. To support herself and her kids, she takes a waitressing job at a small-town diner, where the kind patrons take steps to lighten her load. ~ Brie Hearn, RoviSee All A Christmas Wish Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
