Thomas and his engine buddies travel through the Island of Sodor with some very special cargo including giraffes, cows, birds, bunnies, and more. While Thomas contends with finding the best way to transport a particularly tall giraffe, Percy learns the importance of treating animals with respect, while Belle and Toby discover why listening to others is important. ~ Tracie Cooper, RoviCategories:Family & KidsLooking for special editions of Thomas & Friends: Curious Cargo?See All Versions
