One determined penguin makes it his mission in life to soar through the clouds, even after becoming the laughing stock of his entire community in this animated adventure for the entire family. Piper Penguin goes to Penguinville High. Ever since he hatched, Piper dreamt of the day he would take to the sky. With the help of his loyal friends Pepperoni the test pilot, Winthrop the walrus, and pretty Penny, Piper strives to perfect a machine that will make it possible for penguins to fly. But even with the help of his dad, a respected inventor, every test flight ends in total disaster. Later, when one of Piper's inventions puts the prom in jeopardy and killer whale Wiley plots to destroy Penguinville, the earthbound bird prepares for liftoff, and becomes the the hero he was always meant to be. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Piper Penguin and His Fantastic Flying Machines Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 54&nbsp;mins
