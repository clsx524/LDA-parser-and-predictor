As Halloween approaches, the students at Monster High are framed for a prank on the normies after they attacked the school (as every Halloween, the normies set out to hunt and torment monsters). But when the students learn one of their own is behind the pranks and is going to suffer for it, it is up to Frankie, with the help of some new friends, to stop it. Meanwhile, Draculaura tries to get Clawdeen a date, but instead angers her.
The ghouls of Monster High hope to share Halloween with the "normies" to demonstrate that individuality isn't a bad thing, and neither is being a monster. ~ Tracie Cooper, RoviSee All Monster High: Ghouls Rule Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 72&nbsp;mins
