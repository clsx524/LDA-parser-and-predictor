This direct-to-video, family-oriented inspirational drama takes place in a rural Iowan town of 5,000. Based on a true story, it concerns a group of boys who grow up together playing basketball in tournaments and driveways - and end up on opposite sides of the proverbial fence, playing for rival high schools. Then another twist occurs when each high school yields a championship team - pitting the two against one another in the finals and forcing the young men to learn the importance of family, friendship and a great deal more. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 70&nbsp;mins
