Few things inspire a child's desire to learn than fun and songs, and in this release the Imagination Movers offer a heaping helping of both by offering fifteen educational rock and hip hop tunes designed to make learning fun. With live concert footage and flashy, MTV-styled music videos covering such topics as cleaning your room and brushing your teeth, this video will have parents joining in on the sing-along, too. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviCategories:Family & KidsLooking for special editions of Imagination Movers: Stir it Up?See All Versions
