A pint-sized athlete with a major league dream sets his sights on impressing his imprisoned father, and gets some much-needed help from the last place he expected. Twelve-year-old Lori (Kyle Kirk) has just lost his mother, and his father is in prison. To make matters worse, he's just moved to a new town and he doesn't have any friends. Though Little League tryouts offer a glimmer of hope, disappointment sets in when he fails to make the cut. Meanwhile, the Major League Home Run Derby is on the horizon, and if Lori could just manage to get on TV perhaps his convict dad would have a reason to be proud. And with a little help from athletic tomboy Fassi (Emma-Lee Hess) and massive misfit Tanker (Brandon Balog), he might just make it happen. Dean Cain, Matthew Lillard, and Annabeth Gish co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Home Run Showdown Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 94&nbsp;mins
