A withdrawn foster child makes a Christmas discovery that strengthens her bond with her adoptive family, and makes her a kindly new friend. A lonely child without a family of her own, Julia is elated when she rescues an injured bunny on Christmas Eve. Later, with the help of a kind-hearted farm woman (Florence Henderson), Julia nurses the animal back to health, and realizes the importance of being with the people you love during the most wonderful time of the year. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Christmas Bunny Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 100&nbsp;mins
