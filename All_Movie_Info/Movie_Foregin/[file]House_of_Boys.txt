A gay runaway from Luxembourg becomes a featured dancer at an Amsterdam cabaret, but finds the thrill of his new lifestyle decidedly short-lived as a deadly and mysterious new disease begins sweeping through the gay community in this compassionate drama set during the frightening first wave of the HIVAIDS epidemic. Frank was a teenage misfit just searching for a place to fit in when he left home, and arrived at the House of Boys - a colorful cabaret run by the charismatic Madame (Udo Kier). Before long, Frank is a featured player. But just as Frank has finally found a place where he can embrace his independence, an aggressive virus threatens to destroy the only family he's ever known. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 117&nbsp;mins
