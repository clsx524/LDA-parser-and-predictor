Fate brings together two people who have more in common than the surface would suggest in this drama from filmmaker Cedric Klapisch. France (Karin Viard) is a working-class single mother who finds herself in a tight spot when the factory she's been employed at for two decades is shut down in the wake of a corporate merger. With few prospects in her hometown, she leaves her daughters in the care of her sister and heads to Paris, hoping to find work as a domestic. France lands a job as a housekeeper for Steve (Gilles Lellouche), a smooth-talking businessman who has just relocated to Paris after several years in London, where he negotiated the deal that cost France her job. Steve has a young son, but barely has the time to look after him, and when he's forced to spend a few weeks away on business, he offers France a healthy bonus to take care of the boy. France doesn't mind the work and enjoys seeing how the other half lives, but there's a side to her that Steve doesn't know about, and vice versa. Ma Part du GÃ¢teau (aka My Piece Of The Pie) was an official selection at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 109&nbsp;mins
