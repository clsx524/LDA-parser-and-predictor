The movie was shot on location in and around New York city's Chrysler Building and uses the interior of the building's tower crown as a primary location.
The original music score was composed by Robert O. Ragland.
The film was marketed with the tagline "It's  name is Quetzalcoatl... just call it Q, that's all you'll have time to say before it tears you apart!"
The film poster's glossy monster illustration was painted by science fictionfantasy artist Boris Vallejo.
The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by United Film Distribution Company in October 1982. It grossed approximately $255,000 at the box office.
The film was later released on VHS by MCAUniversal Home Video. It was released on DVD by Blue Underground in 2003.
Roger Ebert gave the film 2 and 12 stars in his original review but was bursting with praise for Moriarty's performance. He relates the anecdote that, when movie reviewer Rex Reed met Q's producer, Samuel Z. Arkoff, Reed told him "What a surprise! All that dreck—and right in the middle of it, a great Method performance by Michael Moriarty!" Arkoff replied "The dreck was my idea." Andrew Smith at Popcorn Pictures said that the film was tough going at times but picked up whenever the monster was on screen.
