The residents of a small town feel different varieties of grief in the wake of a shocking death in this independent drama from director Gaby Dellal. Angels Crest is a community at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, where local news is rarely interesting and nearly everyone knows one another. Ethan (Thomas Dekker) is a young man in his early twenties who was once involved with Cindy (Lynn Collins); it's common knowledge that Cindy has a serious drinking problem, and the responsibility of looking after their three-year-old son usually falls to Ethan. While out on a fishing trip on a snowy day, Ethan leaves the boy alone in his car for a few minutes; when Ethan returns, his son has somehow gotten away, and days later the boy's frozen remains are found in the woods. Ethan is shattered by this turn of events, and many in Angels Crest feel sorry for him, but Cindy isn't one of them. Meanwhile, a local prosecutor assigned to the case (Jeremy Piven) must come to terms with his own demons as he prepares to charge Ethan with negligent homicide. Featuring a distinguished supporting cast including Mira Sorvino, Elizabeth McGovern, and Kate Walsh, Angels Crest received its world premiere at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Angels Crest Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 93&nbsp;mins
