Cirkus Columbia is a Bosnian and Herzegovinian 2010 drama film starring Miki Manojlović, Mira Furlan, Boris Ler and Jelena Stupljanin. The film is set in the Herzegovina part of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s, after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and slightly before the Yugoslav Wars. It tells an emotional story of a man coming back to his hometown after many years abroad and dealing with his past and current family, using the political dealings of the region as a backdrop. It is based on the novel Cirkus Columbia by well known Bosnian Croat writer Ivica Đikić.
The film was selected as the Bosnian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist.
A man returns to Herzegovina to reclaim his ancestral home following the fall of communism, and finds his life spinning into a frenzy following the loss of his lucky cat in director Danis Tanovic's adroit political drama. The year is 1991. Divko Buntic has spent the past 20 years in Germany, living a life of luxury. His mint Mercedes is noticeably out of place when he arrives back in Herzegovina with Azra, his gorgeous young girlfriend and Bonny, his lucky cat, and after using his clout to have his estranged wife Lucija thrown out onto the street, Divko attempts to make amends with Martin, his 20-year-old son. But everything starts to fall apart when Bonny vanishes without a trace, as the townspeople race to find the feline and collect a handsome reward. Meanwhile, trouble begins brewing as Divko and Azra drift apart, and the younger girl finds herself increasingly drawn to Martin. Amidst all of the drama, practically no one in town notices when Croatia secedes, and Serbian bombs start falling on Dubrovnik. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 113&nbsp;mins
