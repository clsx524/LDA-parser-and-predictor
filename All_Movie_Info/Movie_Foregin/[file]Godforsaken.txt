A nameless fallen angel descends to Earth seeking redemption for the death of a young innocent who perished while under his protection in this supernatural thriller from writerproducerdirector Jamil Dehlavi. Sixteen years ago, the angel appeared on Earth. His mission was to protect a child, but he failed. Now the angel is back. He's taken human form, but the wounds on his back betray his appearance. As Lucille prepares to confess to a priest, it soon becomes apparent that the angel may be nothing more than a personification of a grieving mother's all-consuming madness. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Godforsaken Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 82&nbsp;mins
