This direct-to-video supernatural thriller concerns Mike Crowel, a CID agent who has survived a rocky period with his wife and gets within arm's reach of reconciliation with her. At about the same time, his department heads assign him to a strange, beguiling case involving a clique of four friends - Dave, Martin, Jake and Sarah. As Mike begins to dig more deeply into the case, evil forces and inexplicable supernatural events turn their lives upside down. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
