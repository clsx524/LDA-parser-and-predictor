Virginie Despentes, director of the controversial 2001 thriller Baise-Moi, offers this pro-sex feminist look at pornography in all its various forms, interviewing members of the "post porn" movement along the way while asserting that pornography could play a key role in liberating oppressed minorities. Conversations with Annie Sprinkle, Catherine Breillat, Lydia Lunch, Del La Grace Volcano, Norma Jean Almodovar, and others offer insight into both Despentes' compelling theory about the power of pornography, as well as the various sub-genres such as queer porn, punk porn, and S&M porn. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
