Burning Man is a 2011 Australian drama film written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky. On 10 April 2012, Burning Man won Best Music Score for Lisa Gerrard and Best Editing for Martin Connor at the 2011 Film Critics Circle of Australia.
Fiona Williams of SBS awarded the film four stars out of five, observing that the film is an "experiential kaleidoscope of sex, love, and the numbing nihilism that accompanies a traumatic event." She also notes that "Burning Man manages to bring energy, originality and depth to a storyline that is itself something of a trope: ‘The Cancer Film’."
A man struggles to keep his emotions in check after the death of his wife in this drama written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky. Tom (Matthew Goode) is a passionate and forthright individual who is accustomed to speaking his mind. But Tom seems to have lost his emotional anchors since his wife Sarah (Bojana Novakovic) succumbed to cancer. Tom struggles with rage and confusion, and has begun verbally lashing out at his son Oscar (Jack Heanly) and Sarah's sister Karen (Essie Davis). Tom has also been sleeping with practically any woman that will have him, and while he hasn't lost all of his charm, his ability to bend others to his will is fading fast, and a traumatic event forces him to take a long look at the way he treats others. Not to be confused with the annual "radical self-expression" held in Nevada, Burning Man received its world premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Burning Man Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 109&nbsp;mins
