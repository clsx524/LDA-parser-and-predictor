Aspiring 11 year old actress Vanessa (Alice Ziolkoski) and her three, fun-loving best friends savor their last summer before making the leap to middle school while embarking on four inspirational, sun-soaked adventures. As Vanessa prepares for the audition of a lifetime, Lizzie (Meaghan Hughes) welcomes home her wheelchair-bound, war veteran brother; Jess (Sarah Butterworth) contends with the pain of her parents separating; and a heavy secret weighs on the conscience of their new friend Peri (Sydney Fox). Before the summer has ended, all four girls will find the courage and friendship to face any challenge that life throws their way. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Summer Eleven Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 93&nbsp;mins
