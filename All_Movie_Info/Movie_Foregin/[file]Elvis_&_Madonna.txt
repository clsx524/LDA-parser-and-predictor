Opposites attract in a truly unexpected way in this offbeat romantic comedy from Brazilian filmmaker Marcelo Laffitte. Elvis (Simone Spoladore) is a photographer living in Rio de Janeiro who is trying to get her career off the ground. Elvis's family are having money troubles, and since her work isn't bringing in much money, she takes a part-time job delivering pizzas to earn some cash on the side. One evening, Elvis delivers a pizza to Madonna (Igor Cotrim), a drag performer at a local nightclub who is being attacked by Johnny Tripod (Sergio Bezerra), Madonna's sleazy sometime boyfriend. Elvis immediately comes to Madonna'a rescue, and the two become fast friends. Before long, they find that they're strongly attracted to one another, but since Elvis is a lesbian and Madonna is a gay man, they're both thrown for a loop by their new love. As the new couple tries to make sense of their relationship, Elvis wants to raise the money to help her dad while Madonna dreams of finding a backer for a spectacular new show. Elvis and Madonna received its North American premiere at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 105&nbsp;mins
