A woman has her life turned upside down in unexpected ways by a well-meaning slob in this comedy from director and co-screenwriter Anne Fontaine. Agathe (Isabelle Huppert) and Francois (Andre Dussollier) are a pair of upper-class intellectuals who have been together for years; she manages an art museum, and he works in publishing. The couple is raising a son, Adrien (Donatien Suner), but the spark has gone out of their relationship and their bond is based on tolerance rather than love. Patrick (Benoit Poelvoorde) is a Belgian handyman whose son Tony (Corentin Devroey) is close friends with Adrien; when Francois learns that Patrick may lose custody of his son because he's out of work, he offers him some work doing remodeling at their home. While Patrick is certainly a pest, he loves his son, and his carefree and unpretentious manner rubs off on his employers. After Francois walks out on Agathe, she takes in Patrick and Tony, and the two single parents stumble into a deeper relationship. Mon Pire Cauchemar (aka My Worst Nightmare) received its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 100&nbsp;mins
