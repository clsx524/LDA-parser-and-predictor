School is out, and with the endless possibilities that summer has to offer, Judy (Jordana Beatty) plans to have fun in the sun with her best pals Rocky and Amy. And right after learning that Rocky and Amy will both be leaving town with their families until fall, Judy finds out that her own parents are taking a trip to sunny California without the kids. At first Judy grows depressed at the thought of spending the summer at home with her little brother, Stink (Parris Mosteller), and their friend Frank Pearl, but once their aunt Opal (Heather Graham) arrives, things quickly start to look up. Later, after making a list of dares to spice up their summer at home, Judy and her friends discover you don't have to travel far to find real fun, because every day is an adventure if you want it to be. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
