Domain is a 2009 French film directed by Patric Chiha, starring Béatrice Dalle, Isaïe Sultan, and Alain Libolt. The film has been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2011 Maryland Film Festival.
A teenage boy discovers he has a crush on his attractive and likewise eccentric maths teacher Nadia. He manages to become her best friend and she seems to enjoy to support him while he's coming of age. This lasts until he realises she suffers with alcoholism.
Beatrice Dalle's performance was described as impressive.  On the other hand it was said the film would occasionally repeat itself.
A young man's growing maturity has an unexpected effect on a member of the family in this drama from France. Seventeen-year-old Pierre (Isaie Sultan) is a high school student who has trouble relating to his peers and spends much of his free time talking with his aunt Nadia (Beatrice Dalle), a onetime professor of mathematics who loves to share her thoughts about the theory of dominance and how order appeals to her. Pierre's mother Jeanne (Tatiana Vialle) regards her sister Nadia as a poor role model, primarily because of her heavy drinking, and urges her son to make friends his own age. Part of Pierre's shyness around his classmates from school comes from his growing understanding of his homosexuality, but he becomes more comfortable with himself after he meets another gay teen, Fabrice (Manuel Marmier), and they edge into a tentative romance. However, Nadia misses her frequent chats with Pierre, and her fondness for liquor gives way to full-blown, self-destructive alcoholism. Domaine was the first feature film from writer and director Patric Chiha. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 110&nbsp;mins
