A teenage girl abandons her dreams of becoming a world-renowned ballet dancer in favor of rescuing her best friend - a 5 ton elephant named Sheba - from the circus in this charming tale for the entire family. Sophie's (Brittany Bristow) parents own a small family-operated zoo. As a result, as Sophie grew up she developed an unusual rapport with all creatures great and small. But her closest friend was also her biggest; from the first time they met, Sophie and Sheba the elephant were inseparable. When her parents sell Sheba to a traveling circus in order to pay for Sophie's tuition fees at the American Ballet, the young girl joins the show in order to protect her friend from his new, heavy-handed trainer Magnus. Before long, however, Sophie has struck a deal with circus owner Alistair Winston (John Rhys-Davies) that will allow her to earn Sheba back by performing with her. Yet despite Sophie's determination to get Sheba back home to the family zoo, the teen begins having second thoughts about her plan when a reporter points out that the elephant might be happier back in Africa. Later, after striking up a romance with a kindhearted young trapeze artist named Blake, Sophie begins to realize that sometimes doing what is best for the ones we love requires making a substantial personal sacrifice. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Sophie Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 103&nbsp;mins
