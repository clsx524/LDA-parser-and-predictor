A number of teenage girls dive headfirst into adulthood, much to the consternation of the grown-ups around them, in this comedy-drama from French filmmakers Delphine Coulin and Muriel Coulin. Camille (Louise Grinberg) is a beautiful 17-year-old attending a well-respected school for girls in Brittany. She is cool, popular, and the center of her social circle at school -- so much so that when she discovers that her boyfriend Tom (Arthur Verret) has gotten her pregnant, several of her friends consider following suit, especially after outcast Florence (Roxane Duran) becomes Camille's newest BFF when she learns she's also expecting. Within a few months, 16 of Camille's classmates are pregnant; parents and educators wonder how to combat this sudden epidemic, while the girls revel in the notion of freedom from their parents and the unconditional love of their children without fully considering the responsibilities of motherhood -- or the notion that many aspects of the teenage lifestyle are not conducive with a healthy pregnancy, including partying and sneaking out at night. Inspired by a real-life story that took place in Gloucester, MA (and was the basis of an American made-for-cable drama), 17 Filles (aka 17 Girls) was an official selection at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
