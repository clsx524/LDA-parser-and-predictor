Chance is an elderly gentleman who has made a fortune as the silent owner of a popular Atlanta restaurant, but you wouldn't know it to look at him. For the past forty years, Chance has worked as a dishwasher and busboy at the restaurant, quietly enduring the ridicule and criticism of his fellow coworkers as a means of self-punishment for an early-life sin. One day, Chance dies suddenly and unexpectedly. But Chance has no friends or family to speak of, so who will inherit his sizable fortune? ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 87&nbsp;mins
