David & Layla is a 2005 independent film directed by Jay Jonroy.
Inspired by a true story, sparks fly when a Jew and a Muslim fall in love in New York. David (David Moscow), TV host of "Sex & Happiness", becomes smitten with the voluptuous Layla (Shiva Rose) - a mysterious, sensual dancer who turns out to be a refugee. David's reckless pursuit of Layla sets off an unveiling of the similarities and contrasts of their ancient cultures. His lust grows into love as he discovers in stunning Layla a sensitive, intelligent war survivor with a rich culture that echoes his own. But their families are dead set against their unlikely romance. Faced with deportation, Layla must choose: David or Dr. Ahmad? Will David and Layla follow their hearts and blast through centuries of religious animosity? The film was inspired by the true story of the Muslim-Jewish couple Alwand Jaff and her husband David Ruby, both of whom have cameo roles in the film.
The Washington Post called it "a frothy little romantic comedy." Variety described it as "an earnest, frequently funny comedy." Film Journal International said "the picture takes its time in developing momentum; once attained, it becomes a watchable, optimistic cri de coeur."
This warm and breezy romantic comedy from director Jay Jonroy explores an interracial romance between the unlikeliest of partners: a Muslim refugee and a New York Jew.  David Fine (David Moscow), the host of a Big Apple man-on-the-street TV show called "Sex and Happiness," never expected to meet and fall in love with a Middle Eastern immigrant - particularly given his marital engagement to a Jewish partner, Abby (Callie Thorne). But his path soon intersects with that of Layla, a young woman orphaned when Saddam Hussein's troops gassed the rest of her family. She now lives with relatives in Manhattan, and (unbeknownst to the kinfolk, who believe she's a nursing student) supports herself by collecting under the table for a slightly suggestive dance act - the warm-up for a local belly dancer. With deportation looming, Layla looks for an out; a customs official suggests a marriage of convenience, but that soon becomes unnecessary when Layla meets David and deep, abiding love blooms. . . to the horror of both families. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviSee All David & Layla Trailers and ClipsComplete Cast of David & LaylaDavid Moscow - David FinePeter Van Wagner - Mel FineCallie Thorne - AbbyEd Chemaly - Uncle Ali &#034;Al&#034;Anna George - ZinaAlbert Macklin - Dr. SussweinTibor Feldman - Rabbi RabinovichRandy Cherkas - Ken, ImmigrationC.S.
