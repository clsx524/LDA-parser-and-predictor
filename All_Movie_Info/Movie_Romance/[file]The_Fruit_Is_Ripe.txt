In this summer drama, three young women take jobs as fruit pickers. One of them is a tease, one is a tough-girl, and one is incurably romantic. As they work in the summer's heat they find themselves increasingly attracted to their handsome co-workers. Hot love ensues as they all pair off. Unfortunately, their summer fun is spoiled by the death of one of the men. When not making love, the young people are involved in staging a successful strike. ~ Sandra Brennan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
