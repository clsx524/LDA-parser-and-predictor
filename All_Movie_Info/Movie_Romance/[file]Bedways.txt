A film director and her two friends forge an intensely erotic connection while making a movie about love and sex in this provocative drama from Germany. Nina Bader (Miriam Mayet) is a filmmaker on a mission to capture a depiction of pure, uninhibited sex. Young, beautiful, and completely open with their sexuality, Marie (Lana Cooper) and Hans (Matthias Faust) are the perfect candidates for the project. As the production gets under way and the atmosphere on the set grows thick with lust, the barrier between reality and cinema begins to vanish, sweeping all three up in a libertine whirlwind of flesh and desire. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 79&nbsp;mins
