A high school senior and his English teacher fall deeply in love despite their better judgment in this taboo yet tender romantic drama. In a few months, Evan will turn 18 and graduate from high school. But when you're in love, a day can seem like an eternity, and Evan is deeply smitten with his beautiful teacher Mrs. Willis. When passions flare out of control and they both give in to their carnal instincts, Mrs. Willis attempts to distance herself from Evan for fear that she will lose her job and go to jail. But the harder Mrs. Willis pushes Evan away, the more convinced he becomes that the love they share is true. Now, unless they can keep their secret safe until Evan earns his diploma, the love that defines them, may ultimately destroy them. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 86&nbsp;mins
