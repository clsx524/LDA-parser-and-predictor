The Duchess of Langeais is a 2007 French film directed by Jacques Rivette.
Its original French title is Ne touchez pas la hache ("Don't touch the axe"), and it is based on the 1834 novel of the same name by Honoré de Balzac.
The film stars Jeanne Balibar and Guillaume Depardieu as lovers in early 1823 Majorca who are involved in a tormented and frustrating relationship.
Guillaume Depardieu, Jeanne Balibar, and Michel Piccoli star in director Jacques Rivette's adaptation of the Balzac novella The Duchesse de Langeais, which tells the tale of a Parisian socialite who is romantically pursued by a Napoleonic war hero. The story begins as grieving French general Armand de Montriveau (Depardieu) arrives at a Majorcan church to speak with French nun Antionette le Langeais (Balibar). General de Montriveau believes le Langeais to be a woman he once loved dearly, but eventually lost. As the pair is reunited under the watchful eyes of the presiding priest and mother superior, their romantic past gradually comes into focus. It was five years ago that bored socialite Antoinette first became enamored with the wounded soldier whose rousing tales of adventure offered exciting contrast to her highly refined lifestyle. Though she was married at the time, the coquettish cosmopolitan quickly fell under the spell of the commanding military man -- who vowed that very night that Antoinette would be his lover. As their romance grows more complicated, the passionate pair finds it increasingly difficult to deny the powerful connection that binds them. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviComplete Cast of The Duchess of LangeaisJeanne Balibar - Antoinette de LangeaisBulle Ogier - Princesse de Blamont-ChauvryBarbet Schroeder - Le Duc de GrandlieuMathias JungMarc BarbéThomas DurandVictoria ZinnyPaul ChevillardGuillaume Depardieu - Armand de MontriveauMichel Piccoli - Vidame de PamiersAnne CantineauJulie JuddNicolas BouchaudBeppe ChiericiRemo GironeDirector(s):Jacques RivetteWriter(s):Jacques Rivette,&nbsp;Christine Laurent,&nbsp;Pascal BonitzerProducer(s):Maurice Tinchant,&nbsp;Martine Mariganc
