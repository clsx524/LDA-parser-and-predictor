A fleeing fugitive discovers the power of community after posing as a priest to hide out in a small town, then running afoul of a local crime kingpin. Maximiliano (Eduardo Rivera) is on the lam when he puts on a collar and convinces the citizens of a small town he's a man of the cloth. Over time, the townspeople warm to Maximiliano, and the cunning con-man even falls in love. When a powerful crime lord (Eric Del Castillo) attempts to impose his will on the locals, Maximiliano comes to their rescue and discovers that small town people can have incredibly big hearts. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
