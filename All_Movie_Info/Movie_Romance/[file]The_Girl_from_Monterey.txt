The world of boxing provides the framework for this romantic musical that tells the story of Baby and his manager who is also his sister. Baby is slated to fight Jerry O'Leary, but his sister won't let him because she is in love with the opponent. To ensure that the two do not fight, O'Leary's manager hires a seductress to keep Baby's mind off fighting during training. Fortunately the boxing commission learns of the scam and intervenes in the nick of time. ~ Sandra Brennan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 59&nbsp;mins
