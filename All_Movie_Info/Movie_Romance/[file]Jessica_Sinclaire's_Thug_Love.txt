A forty-something advertising executive in the midst of a difficult divorce finds her passionate affair by a streetwise artist nearly half her age threatening to derail her career and destroy her life in this racy romantic drama. Destiny's professional life may be at a ten, but her personal life is about to bottom out. Her marriage has eroded, and now as the details of the divorce are being finalized, Destiny meets handsome young artist Troy. Troy is young enough to be Destiny's son, though their connection is both immediate and passionate. With Troy, Destiny's dormant sensual nature is suddenly reawakened. But before long, lust has turned to obsession, and Destiny's career starts to suffer. If Destiny can just get a grip on her romantic life while still keeping sight of her professional goals, perhaps she can emerge from this conflict with more than she had going in. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 85&nbsp;mins
