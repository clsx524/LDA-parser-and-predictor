King Edvard (Chris Geere) and Queen Paige (Kam Heskin) journey to Asia to attend the wedding of Princess Myra of Sangyoon (Ase Wang), and find themselves on the adventure of a lifetime when things don't go as smoothly as planned. Upon arriving in Sangyoon, the young King and Queen discover that the Myra is desperate to get out of the arranged marriage. Her prospective future husband Kah (Prinya Intach) is downright malevolent, and Myra's true heart lies with Alu (Amarin Cholvibul), a kindly young elephant handler. When word of Myra and Alu's romance gets out, Alu is imprisoned, and the sacred wedding elephant vanishes into the dense jungle. Now, in order to ensure a happy ending for their dear friend, Edvard and Paige set out to track down the elephant, free Alu, and convince Myra's father that the only way his daughter will ever be happy is to marry the one man she truly loves. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
