The original title of this sexploitationer indicated that someone on the staff had a sense of humor: The Garbageman Cometh. Toney Naylor plays the title role, going about his business in the company of a talking horse. Feeling himself an anachronism, the garbage man is given solace and sexual satisfaction by a gorgeous girl (Venita Beautrice). To the garbage man, she is a dream girl--which is indeed the case, as our hero discovers when he finally wakes up. Most of the humor is predicated on female anatomy and male body functions, which is not to say that it isn't funny. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 84&nbsp;mins
