A Seattle DJ (Shannen Doherty) leaves the city behind to tend to her recently deceased grandfather's farm, which he was in danger of losing to the bank. In order to pay off his debt and save the farm, she decides to enter a local pumpkin-growing contest, which awards the winner a hefty cash prize. She teams up with a neighbor (Kavan Smith) to nurture the seeds, but it's not long until a romance between the two begins to sprout as well. ~ Brie Hearn, RoviSee All Growing the Big One Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
