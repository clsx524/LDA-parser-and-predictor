Those who are familiar with the details of the Cuban Revolution which put Fidel Castro into power may find this film particularly interesting. In this reverently told story, a small band of guerillas are fighting on their own, independently from the Castro-led groups. At first, they are content simply to disrupt public gatherings in a small way, but eventually they graduate to major acts of terrorism. ~ Clarke Fountain, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
