Nelson Hodge is a lower class painter with undiagnosed Asperger syndrome who is immersed in completing a triptych of emotion paintings. Sadie Mitchell is attempting to get her life back in order while sacrificing in most areas of her life. The two meet by chance and engage in an awkward romance that starts to bring their flaws to the surface.
Alex Plank, founder of the Wrong Planet community for autism and autism spectrum disorders, first discussed the film on the organization's website with a February 2008 interview with actor Alvin Keith and director Nicholas Gray. In September 2008 he wrote a review in which he described his appreciation for the film's three-dimensional and unexaggerated interpretation of the disorder, calling it "...the most authentic portrayal of an autistic person I've ever seen in the movies." 
New York Film Critics Circle member, Mike d'Angelo, gave special praise to actress Marin Ireland, calling her work "...one of the most stunning performances I've seen in the past couple of years â€” easily my top Best Actress pick for various polls and surveys, at this writing, should the film get a New York commercial release." 
The film was named Best Feature and Best of Festival at the 2008 Derby City Film Festival in Louisville, Kentucky.
The film's West Coast premiere was at the 2009 Method Fest in Calabasas Ca, near Los Angeles. Method Fest is named after the famous "Method" school of acting, showcases breakout acting performances in character and story-driven films. At this festival the film was presented by award-winning writer Dennis Lehane and earned nominations for Outstanding Achievement in Low Budget Filmmaking and for Best Actress (Marin Ireland).
A one-night-stand between an artist with Asperger's Syndrome and a disillusioned young woman leads to an unlikely romance that helps them both to look beyond society's expectations and realize what they really want out of life in this romantic drama from director Nicolas Gray. His undiagnosed condition having slowly pushed him into the margins of society, Nelson struggles to visualize emotions on canvas that he cannot put into words. Meanwhile, Sadie grows dejected by the fact that she's well into her 20s with no real career prospects, and that life seems to be slowly passing her by. In the wake of a one-night-stand with Sadie, Nelson's emotions begin to swell up inside, inspiring him to paint with a newfound passion. Likewise, Nelson helps Sadie to realize that she'll never live up to the stratospheric expectations she has set for herself, but that as long as they're together, she'll always be happy. As Nelson uses his creativity to show Sadie how he really feels about her, Sadie struggles to make a break with the past so that she can finally be free to live and love on her own terms. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All If You Could Say it in Words Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 110&nbsp;mins
