In this romantic French drama, an older man remembers a meaningful summer romance he had in 1958. It begins as Victor is seen staring into the flames of an apparent bonfire. He is remembering the day he met Yvonne in the luxurious lobby of a Swiss hotel on Lake Geneva. They encounter Dr. Meinthe, the cultured but flagrantly gay medico who provides some form of service for the Algerian war. Together, the threesome revel in a relaxing time all the while, poking fun at the elegant folk around them. ~ Sandra Brennan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
