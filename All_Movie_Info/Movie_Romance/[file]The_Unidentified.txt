Estlin is a journalist in New York City, fresh out of college and ready to make a difference in an all-too cynical world. He struggles with defining career and relationships, and after his best friend Brooke moves away, finds himself falling for Sophie, a downtown photographer. Estlin must confront whether his dogged pursuit of truth helps or hinders his attempt to find a place in the world.

A budding New York City journalist falls for an optimistic artist, only to find that her simplistic outlook on life is driven by a dark undercurrent in director Kevan Tucker's incisive study of 21st Century apathy. Fresh out of college and frustrated that he's not making a difference in the real world, introspective writer Estlin finds his world falling apart when his best friend Brooke announces that she's moving to Ohio. Before long Estlin has fallen for Sophie, an eccentric artist who blocks his attempts at intimacy. Discontented and isolated, Estlin heads to Washington, D.C. to attend a protest. There, in the middle of all the chaos, he begins to realize just how his country has changed since that fateful decade when man landed on the moon, and the future seemed to hold so much promise. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 109&nbsp;mins
