Loosely based on the Parisian fable of Shahrazad and A Thousand and One Nights, director Ali Raffi's romantic drama tells the tale of a man who returns to his home near the Caspian Sea following a twenty-year absence, and the former lover who fears that he plans to destroy her livelihood. It's been a little over two decades since Aziz (Reza Kianian) embarked on an undesired journey, but now he has returned to the Caspian coast and his family's crumbling estate. When Aziz disappeared, his former flame Atieh (Roya Nonahali) commandeered the home and converted it into a small but popular restaurant. Now that Aziz is back, Atieh is convinced that he plans to reclaim his home and put her out of business. In hopes of rekindling the romance and keeping her restaurant open, Atieh calls on her daughter Touka (Golshifteh Farahani) and their colleagues to prepare a series of dishes that will delight Aziz's discerning palate. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
