The wife (Bergner) of a violin player (Brent) in a famous orchestra, falls in love with her husband's friend and, tragically, drowns herself.
In this German-language romantic drama, Elisabeth (Maria Schell) tries to make it to her husband's (O.W. Fischer) performance of Beethoven pieces, but arrives late, only to walk in on the solo violinist, Michael (Philip Dorn). She immediately falls in love, and Michael returns the feeling when he later meets Elisabeth face-to-face. Soon, Elisabeth must make a tough decision in a love triangle in which she is the only aware party. ~ Jonathan Frey, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
