Ester e il re (English Translation: Esther and the King) is a 1960 Italian  U.S.A. religious epic film directed (with Mario Bava, the film's director of photography, who was credited as a co-director on Italian prints of the film ), written, and produced by Raoul Walsh. It was produced at 20th Century Fox Raoul Walsh Productions, and was released by 20th Century Fox. Joan Collins stars as Esther in this melodramatic, routine Biblical story. Based on the Old Testament, this epic recreates the Book of Esther, the tale that is the basis for the Jewish celebration of Purim.
The film is set in Persia in the 5th century BC. After the Kingâ€™s wife is murdered, Esther (a Jewish woman) comes to the attention of the recently widowed King Ahasuerus. The king has been trying to stifle and defeat the campaign of hatred against the Jews by his evil minister Haman (Sergio Fantoni). Before the King can pair off with Esther and defeat the villainous Haman, there are several intervening adventures and an additional, attractive woman who competes for attention.
In this religious drama, a girl from present day named Amelia learns a valuable lesson about sharing when her mom tells her a Bible story about a woman named Esther. Chosen from all the women in the land to be the queen, Esther faces many hardships, and teaches Amelia about the importance of fasting. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 64&nbsp;mins
