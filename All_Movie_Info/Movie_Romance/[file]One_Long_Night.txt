Jon Seda, Alison Eastwood, Paul Rodriguez, Ed Begley, Jr., and Karen Black star in writerproducerdirector David Siquerios' fish out of water comedy following a conservative half-Mexican, half-Caucasian businessman as he attempts to navigate a foreign land that he could have called home. The year is 1994. California Governor Pete Wilson has just signed the proposition that drove a sizable wedge between Mexicans and Americans. Into this catastrophe wanders Richard Macedo (Seda), an average businessman of mixed heritage who's about to get lost in Mexico. Can Richard survive one night in this close but strangely foreign land, or has he been so Americanized that he's forgotten what it means to be a true Mexican? ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All One Long Night Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
