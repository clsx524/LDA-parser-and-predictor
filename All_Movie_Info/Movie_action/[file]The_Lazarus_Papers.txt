A dying man and a desperate woman seek supernatural assistance in defeating a ruthless mercenary hired to kidnap young Asian girls for sexual slavery. Deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, Riker (Gary Daniels) and his men begin rounding up girls. By selling them into the sex trade, the mercenaries will make millions. In the process of kidnapping Nana (Krystal Vee), Riker executes her village's spiritual leader, Aroon (Danny Trejo). Later, following a desperate struggle for escape, Nana crosses paths with Lonny (John Edward Lee), a terminal man who has just cashed in his own life-insurance policy for one last hurrah. Now, with Riker hot on their trail, Nana and Lonny return to Southeast Asia to seek the advice of Aroon - a man with the power to transcend death, and the wisdom of the ages to guide him. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Lazarus Papers Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
