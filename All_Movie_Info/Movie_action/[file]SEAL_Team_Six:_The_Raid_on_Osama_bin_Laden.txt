Workhorse director John Stockwell takes us along on the hunt for 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden in this intense docudrama following the fearless U.S. Navy SEALs who raided the heavily-fortified compound occupied by the world's most wanted terrorist. As top military leaders narrow their search for bin Laden to a massive Pakistani compound, the Pentagon realizes this may be their one chance to capture the man they've been hunting for over a decade. Though consequences of a surprise American military raid in Pakistan could spark serious international tensions, SEAL Team Six is given the orders to strike, setting into motion one of the most daring, crucial, and potentially dangerous missions in modern military history.
