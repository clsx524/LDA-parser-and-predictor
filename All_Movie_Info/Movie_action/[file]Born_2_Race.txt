A headstrong teenage street racer moves in with his estranged father and puts his skills to the ultimate test in a bid to become a legitimate race car driver. When Danny Krueger makes the mistake of crashing into a police cruiser during an illegal street race, his mother reaches her wits end. Later, after moving in with his father, a failed NASCAR driver, Danny sets his sights on winning the NHRA High School Drags. But in order to do that, he'll first have to beat the fastest driver in town - a reigning champ who has no intensions of relinquishing his title. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Born 2 Race Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 99&nbsp;mins
