This animated release from Scooby-Doo follows the gang from Mystery Inc. on a summer camp adventure, as they find themselves solving a caper at Camp Little Moose, where there are too many ghost stories to keep track of. Together, Daphne, Velma, Fred, Shaggy, and of course, Scooby separate fact from fiction and figure out whether the camper's spooky tales are real. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviSee All Scooby-Doo!: Camp Scare Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 75&nbsp;mins
