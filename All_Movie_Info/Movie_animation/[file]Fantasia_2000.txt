Initially released to IMAX theaters at the crescendo of millennial fever and 60 years after the original Fantasia, Fantasia 2000 was meant to revitalize Walt Disney's goal of a constantly evolving film, with new segments replacing old ones with each re-release. Only The Sorcerer's Apprentice remains, with seven new shorts. Angular, abstracted butterfly-like shapes fly through the air in Beethoven's Symphony No. 5; computer-animated whales take flight in Respighi's Pines of Rome; Al Hirschfeld's caricatures of New York life come alive in George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue; Hans Christian Andersen's The Steadfast Tin Soldier is retold with computer animation against Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2, Allegro, Opus 102; frantic flamingos try to stop their yo-yoing comrade in Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns' Carnival of the Animals, Finale; Donald and Daisy Duck play Noah and his wife trying to manage the ark to Sir Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance; and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth are celebrated in Stravinsky's Firebird Suite. ~ Emru Townsend, RoviSee All Fantasia 2000 Trailers and ClipsComplete Cast of Fantasia 2000Steve Martin - NarratorQuincy Jones - NarratorJames Earl Jones - NarratorPenn Jillette - NarratorAngela Lansbury - NarratorItzhak Perlman - NarratorBette Midler - NarratorTeller - NarratorJames Levine - NarratorLeopold Stokowski - Conductor (&#034;Sorcerer's Apprentice&#034; segment)Director(s):Pixote Hunt,&nbsp;Paul Brizzi,&nbsp;James AlgarWriter(s):Eric Goldberg,&nbsp;Don Hahn,&nbsp;David ReynoldsProducer(s):Donald W.
