In the hour-long home video release Live at Broadway Dance Center: Tap Tap Boom!, host Jared Grimes teaches tap dancers with an intermediate to expert level of knowledge the full choreography of three complex and sophisticated tap routines. Grimes encourages participants to stay within the basic dance framework, yet relax enough to modify the routines slightly and incorporate the elements of personal style and slight improvisation into their steps. This enables dancers to avoid the traps of over-concentration and over-disciplined performance that can confine their movements. Grimes's goal involves helping each viewerparticipant to become secure and comfortable in his or her own body while performing, and thus expand the possibilities of each routine. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 60&nbsp;mins
