Prepare for a sound skewering of modern convention as actor and comedian Cedric the Entertainer takes the stage of The Wiltern theater in Los Angeles, California to address a variety of pressing issues both pressing and frivolous in his first-ever HBO special. Of course anyone who knows Cedric knows that there's much more to this man than simple comedy, and in addition to commenting on a variety of issues ranging from Osama Bin Laden, plastic surgery, gas prices, and gay marriage, the multi-faceted funnyman also offers series of spicy song and dance numbers featuring his talented troupe of dancers the "Cedibles." ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 56&nbsp;mins
