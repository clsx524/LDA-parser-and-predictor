Director James Spooner takes a look at the lives of four African-Americans involved in various punk rock scenes throughout the country. Delving into the difficulties faced by Tamar Kali, Matt Davis, Moe Mitchell, and Mariko Jonez as young black people in an exceedingly white world, Afro-Punk: The Rock 'n' Roll Nigger Experience features performances by Kali, Ten Grand, Cipher, and Bad Brains, along with interviews with such seminal punk figures as D.H. Peligro from the Dead Kennedys, Chaka Malik from Orange 9mm, and members of Fishbone. The film premiered at the 2003 San Francisco Black Film Festival. ~ Matthew Tobey, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 67&nbsp;mins
