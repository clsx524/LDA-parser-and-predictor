While John Lennon may have been one of Liverpool's most famous sons, New York was the city he called home in the last ten years of his life, and he often spoke of his love for the Big Apple. Lennon was also a man who wrote eloquently about loss, pain, and the importance of overcoming adversity, and in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a group of musicians and actors came together to perform Lennon's songs to honor his spirit, as well as to raise needed funs to support relief efforts related to 9-11. Hosted by Kevin Spacey, Come Together: A Night for John Lennon's Words & Music includes performances by Yoko Ono, Dave Matthews, Nelly Furtado, Alanis Morissette, Lou Reed, Moby, Marc Anthony, The Isley Bothers, and more, as well as readings from Dustin Hoffman, James Gandolfini, Kevin Bacon, Edie Falco, Leelee Sobieski, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
