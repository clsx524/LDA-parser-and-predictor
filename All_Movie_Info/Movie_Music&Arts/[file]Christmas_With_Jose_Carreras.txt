Carreras is the popular opera star born in Barcelona, Spain, whose singing career began to unfold during the 1970s. He has performed in such highly respected places as London's Royal Opera House and the New York Metropolitan Opera House. During this hour-long holiday program, Carreras sings a number of beautiful Christmas songs, including "Silent Night" and "White Christmas." ~ Elizabeth Smith, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 66&nbsp;mins
