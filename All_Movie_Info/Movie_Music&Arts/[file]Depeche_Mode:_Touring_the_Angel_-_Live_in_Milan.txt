Alternative music fans who may not have been able to make it to Milan for Depeche Mode's 2005-2006 world tour will relish the opportunity to witness this performance featuring various hits from throughout the band's enduring career. In addition to the opportunity to hear live renditions of such fan favorites as "The Sinner in Me", "Personal Jesus", and "Never Let Me Down Again", this release also offers two additional bonus tracks and an extended documentary about the band. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 122&nbsp;mins
