Richard Pryor's performance at the New York Improv on April, 29th, 1971 features the comedian giving his thoughts on sex, drugs, and race relations. Included is "Wino Preacher & Willie the Junkie," showcasing Pryor in the irreverent style that parlayed his career as a stand-up comic into a successful international star of films and television. There is an advisory warning for the strong language. ~ Dan Pavlides, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 46&nbsp;mins
