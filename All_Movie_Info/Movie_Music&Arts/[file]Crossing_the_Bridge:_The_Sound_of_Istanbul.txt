The rich musical heritage of the Turkish metropolis located between the Orient and the Occident comes to the screen in director Fatih Akin's cinematic tribute to Istanbul's thriving music scene. In bringing both historic and recent expressions of Istanbul's unique legacy of music to the screen in a documentary that strives to both inform and entertain, Akin offers compelling insight into both the creative history of the city as well as the lives of the individuals who populate it. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
