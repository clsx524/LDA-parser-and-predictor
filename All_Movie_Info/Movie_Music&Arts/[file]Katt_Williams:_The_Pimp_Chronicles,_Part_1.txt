Gangsta' attitude blends with hilarious observational humor and a spot-on sense of comic timing as comedian Katt Williams takes the stage of the Atlanta Civic Center and cameras roll to capture every hilarious moment. A street smart comic with a special connection to his many fans, Williams delivers a clever, refreshingly unrestrained brand of stand-up that will have fans howling with laughter. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 54&nbsp;mins
