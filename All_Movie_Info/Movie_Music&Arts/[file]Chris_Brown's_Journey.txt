Pop-flavored R&B vocalist Chris Brown gets up close and personal with his fans as film crews follow him from the Grammys to the U.K. and Japan in preparation for his first international concert tour. Of course a Chris Brown release wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of such chart-topping hits as "Run It!", "Yo (Excuse me Miss)", and "Gimme That", and in addition music videos for each one of those three fan favorites and a live performance from Rhapsody.com, Brown also offers a peek behind-the-scenes with a look at the making of the videos, a quick lesson in krumping, and a hilarious collection of bloopers. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 70&nbsp;mins
