Two incontestable facts are that kids like to move and they like to make noise. This video from Kultur Films Inc. is a constructive and instructive way to accomplish both, while still learning the art of dance. Taught by dancer, choreographer, teacher, and costume designer, Rosemary Boross, this tape takes the viewer to the land of sweet taps. A place where children aged 4 to 8 can explore their creativity and discover expression through the world of tap. With an introduction to the fundamentals accompanied with up-beat music and lyrics this dance lesson is 57 minutes of focused energy and floor pounding fun. ~ C.
