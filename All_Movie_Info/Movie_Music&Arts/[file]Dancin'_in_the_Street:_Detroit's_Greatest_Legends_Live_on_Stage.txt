Motown Records created one of the most distinctive sounds in the history of rock and roll. Based in Detroit, Michigan, the label created, along with the British invasion, the soundtrack of the cultural upheaval that was the 1960s. This documentary captures a 1987 reunion concert featuring some of Motown's biggest stars including Martha Reeves, Mary Wells, David Ruffin, and Eddie Kendricks. They perform over two-dozen songs including "My Guy," "Nowhere to Run," "Heat Wave," "Just My Imagination," "Ain't Too Proud to Beg," and "The Way You Do the Things You Do." ~ Perry Seibert, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
