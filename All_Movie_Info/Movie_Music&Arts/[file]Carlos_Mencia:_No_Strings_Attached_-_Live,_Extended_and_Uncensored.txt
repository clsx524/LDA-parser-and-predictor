Observance and politically-incorrect comic Carlos Mencia commands the stage of San Francisco's Warfield Theater for an audacious night of no-holds-barred comedy that covers a wide ranging variety of topics ranging from religion and diversity to terrorism and race. Few comics can offer such astute observations about such sensitive issues as Mencia, and when the bad boy comic gets on a roll about the pope or the handicapped, he truly brings out the absurdity of day-to-day life as few other comedians can. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 62&nbsp;mins
