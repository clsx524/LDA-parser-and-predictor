Last of the Pony Riders was also the last theatrical starring feature of singing cowboy Gene Autry. This time, Autry plays a troubleshooter for the Pony Express who hopes to keep the West safe for the mail riders so that a new stagecoach line can be established. He is opposed by crooked banker Clyde Vesey (Howard Wright), who wants to land the mail franchise himself and isn't above murder to accomplish his goals. Vesey enlists the aid of a band of outlaws who disguise themselves as Indians while wreaking havoc on the mail service. Featured in the cast as one of the pony riders is Dick Jones, who starred in such Autry-produced TV shows as Range Rider and Buffalo Bill Jr. While not Gene Autry's best film, Last of the Pony Riders is an immensely satisfying ride into the sunset for this personable western hero. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 59&nbsp;mins
