According to Appalachian folklore, in the year 1856 a man emerged from the mountain wilderness around Cold Springs, North Carolina to avenge his father's death. His vengeance was so powerful that by the time he was finished, nothing was left but a ghost town. Twenty years later, when his daughter's honor is brought into question, the mysterious avenger returns to ensure that justice is served. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 115&nbsp;mins
