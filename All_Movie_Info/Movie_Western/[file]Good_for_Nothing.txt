Mike Wallis' unusual Western Good for Nothing stars Cohen Holloway as a bandit who kidnaps a young woman (Inge Rademeyer) and attempts to have his way with her, but finds himself struck by impotence. He holds onto his captive while looking for a cure for his condition, but eventually the two find themselves on the run from a posse who believe that the woman is his accomplice and aim to kill them both. ~ Perry Seibert, RoviSee All Good for Nothing Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
