Val Kilmer stars as the corpse of a wanted man in this western exploring the greed and iniquity of the lawless frontier. When a stranger rides into a small town toting the lifeless body of a noted outlaw, his intentions are to collect the bounty and be on his way. But the situation becomes complicated when the stranger sits down for a high-stakes card game with the drunken sheriff. With nothing to wager but the body he arrived with, the stranger calls the sheriff's bluff and goes all in. Later, despite the fact that he lost the game, the stranger vows to keep the corpse at all costs. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 94&nbsp;mins
