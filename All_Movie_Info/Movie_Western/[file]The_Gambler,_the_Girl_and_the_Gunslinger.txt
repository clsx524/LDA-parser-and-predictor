The Gambler, the Girl and the Gunslinger is a 2009 Drama directed by Anne Wheeler, starring Dean Cain, James Tupper and Allison Hossack. Two mortal enemies must band together to defend the ranch they've both staked their claim on in this rollicking western comedy starring Dean Cain and Natasha Henstrige.
The Gambler wins half the ranch. The Gunslinger is not amused. The Girl loves the gunslinger. A band of ~500 terrorists invade with plans for a new nation. The US army plans to blow everything up to defend the USA. The Gambler likes the girl, and stays on to help, saves the gunslinger because of her. Then Gambler & Slinger blow up a few rebels, and the GGG live happily (maybe) ever after on the ranch.
Two mortal enemies must band together to defend the ranch they've both staked their claim on in this rollicking western comedy starring Dean Cain and Natasha Henstrige. When B.J. (James Tupper) wagered half of his ranch in a bet with Shea (Cain), he never thought he'd come out on the losing end. Now that ownership of the ranch is split down the middle, the two gamblers can't quite agree on anything. The most hotly contested debate to result from the wager isn't the ranch, however, but the hand of the lovely Liz Calhoun (Allison Hossack). Both men want Liz, but neither man can have her. When a gang of bandits makes a bid for the ranch, B.J. and Shea momentarily put their differences aside to fight shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Gambler, the Girl and the Gunslinger Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
