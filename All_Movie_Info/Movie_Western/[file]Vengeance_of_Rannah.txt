Vengeance of Rannah is a 1936 American western directed by Bernard B. Ray and produced by Ray and Harry S. Webb for Reliable Pictures, starring Bob Custer and Rin Tin Tin Jr.
Insurance investigator Ted Sanders is assigned to look into a robberymurder. When he arrives at the crime scene he is met by a local deputy. What he doesn't know, however, is that the "deputy" is actually part of the gang that committed the crime. He plants some of the stolen money in Sanders' room to frame him for the crime, then arrests him.
Starring the supposed offspring of legendary canine Rin-Tin-Tin, this listless Western, "based on a story by James Oliver Curwood" also featured former silent screen cowboy Bob Custer, as laconic and pedestrian a personality as ever. Custer played Ted Saunders an undercover agent attempting to catch the villains who murdered and robbed the owner of a stagecoach line. The only witness to the crime is the dead man's faithful dog, Rannah (Rin-Tin-Tin, Jr., who becomes the next target of the killers. Nearing the end of his career, Custer basically stood back and led the dog do his thing. The two had met before, in the Mascot serial The Law of the Wild (1934) which, despite its miniscule budget, was a near masterpiece in comparison to the dreadful The Vengeance of Rannah. Rinty, Jr. returned the following year opposite Rex Lease in The Silver Trail, the final release of Poverty Row company Reliable Pictures Corp. Both films were directed by "Franklin Shamray" and "Henri Samuels," producers Bernard B. Ray and Harry S. Webb, respectively. ~ Hans J. Wollstein, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 56&nbsp;mins
