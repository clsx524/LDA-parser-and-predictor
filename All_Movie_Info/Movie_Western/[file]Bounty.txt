An outlaw-turned-bounty hunter races to pay off a lingering debt in order to avoid a grim date with the hangman's noose. Shortly after arriving in the rough and tumble town of La Guijas, Nate (Jarrett LeMaster) takes notice of imprisoned outlaw "The Sparkle Eyed Kid" (Michelle Acuna). The bounty on the beautiful outlaw's head is just enough to cover Nate's lingering debt, but in order to collect he'll have to break her out of jail first. Desperate, Jim takes on the local law and one relentless posse in order to take custody of "The Sparkle Eyed Kid" and collect the bounty that will save his neck. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
