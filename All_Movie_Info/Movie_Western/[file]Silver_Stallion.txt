Silver Stallion (은마는 오지 않는다 - Eunma neun oji anhneunda), aka The Silver Stallion Will Never Come, is an award-winning 1991 South Korean film. Based on the novel by An Chong-hyo. 
Soldiers with the U.N. forces that entered Korea during the Korean War rape a village girl named Eon-rae. The villagers ostracize Eon-rae and her son. Unable to make a living, Eon-rae joins the brothel district that has been set up near the U.N. base on the other side of the river from the village. The war and the introduction of U.S. culture break down the social order of the village. After several village children have died, the villagers put the blame on the prostitutes. Eventually the villagers, unable to maintain the village, leave their homes one by one. Eon-rae and her son also leave.
Stuntman extraordinaire David Sharpe is the human star of the adventure quickie Silver Stallion. The bulk of the story, however, is carried by the title horse, who is forced to defend himself and his turf against the villainous Black Stallion (played by Black Jack). Silver Stallion's best friend turns out to be a police dog named Captain Boots. Meanwhile, aspiring horse-thief Davey (Sharpe) is dissuaded from his intention to pilfer the Silver Stallion by the love of a good woman named Jan. The ingenue role is filled by radio actress Janet Waldo, who was still active in the 1990s as the voice of cartoon heroine Judy Jetson. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 60&nbsp;mins
