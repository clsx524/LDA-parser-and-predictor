Land of Hunted Men is a 1943 American film directed by S. Roy Luby, one of the Range Busters films.
The Range Busters bust the range once more in Monogram's Land of Hunted Men. This time around, the star trio consists of Ray "Crash" Corrigan (returning to the Range Busters series after a brief hiatus), Dennis Moore and Max Terhune. The villains, led by good old Charles King, are terrorizing a small town, setting up an "outlaw's hideaway" for themselves. Their reign lasts about 58 minutes of screen time. Best to revel in the ridin' and shootin' in Land of Hunted Men and ignore the alleged comedy relief of black actor Fred "Snowflake" Toones. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 57&nbsp;mins
