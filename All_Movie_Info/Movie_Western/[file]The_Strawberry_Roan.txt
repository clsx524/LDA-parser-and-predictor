The Strawberry Roan is a 1948 American Western film directed by John English and starring Gene Autry, Gloria Henry, and Jack Holt. Based on a story by Julian Zimet, the film is about a singing cowboy who prevents the shooting of a horse that bucked a young boy paralyzing him. The cowboy trains the horse hoping to return it to the boy to help him overcome his disability.
Joe is paralyzed by a wild horse, a strawberry roan. His father, Walt, tries to kill the horse in anger but is unsuccessful and the horse escapes. Autry, who stopped Walt from killing the animal, is asked to leave the ranch. He finds the horse and trains it in the hopes of returning it to Joe to give him the will to overcome his disability.
Gene Autry's equine sidekick Champion takes the center stage in western drama, based on a story by fellow sagebrush star Ken Maynard. Walt Bailey (Jack Holt) is teaching his young son Joe (Dickie Jones) how to break in a horse when a high-spirited steed (Champion) throws the boy, leaving him severely injured. Furious, Walt demands that the horse be killed, but instead it escapes and ranch foreman Gene (Gene Autry) decides to train the horse rather than destroy it. When Gene returns with the horse, Walt's range returns anew, but Gene senses that the newly tamed horse's spirit could help inspire Joe to overcome his handicap. This was Gene Autry's first picture in color, and (of course) featured him singing five songs of the West. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 79&nbsp;mins
