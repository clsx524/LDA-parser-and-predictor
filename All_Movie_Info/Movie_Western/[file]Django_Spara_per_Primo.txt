Franco Nero is the actor most closely associated with the Django spaghetti westerns, but it's Glenn Saxon who stars in Django Shoots First. Actually, Saxon plays the son of famed gunslinger Django. Inheriting half of a dirty little frontier town, Django Jr. can't imagine that anyone would want this hellhole. But someone does: Django Sr's unsavory (and very funny) ex-partner Fernando Sancho. Played mostly for laughs, Django Shoots First is one of the more frolicsome entries in this long-running series. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 84&nbsp;mins
