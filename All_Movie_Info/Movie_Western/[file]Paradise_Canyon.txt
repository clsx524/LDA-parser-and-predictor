Paradise Canyon is a 1935 Western film starring John Wayne, directed by Carl L. Pierson. The film was Wayne's final Monogram PicturesLone Star Production Western.
John Wyatt (John Wayne) is a government agent sent to smash a counterfeiting operation near the Mexican border. Joining Doc Carter's medicine show they arrive in the town where Curly Joe (Yakima Canutt), who once framed Carter, resides. Learning that Curly Joe is the counterfeiter, Wyatt goes after the man himself.
In 2008, Legend Films colorized and renamed the film as Guns Along The Trail, for a DVD collection that features several other "Poverty Row" era John Wayne films.
Paradise Canyon is one of the most action-packed entries in John Wayne's "Lone Star" series. On the trail of a counterfeiting gang, undercover agent John Wyatt (Wayne) joins the traveling medicine show of Doc Carter (Earl Hodgins). For a while, it looks as though Doc is the leader of the gang, but when he and his daughter, Linda (Marion Burns), are kidnapped by the real villain, Wyatt realizes he's been riding the wrong trail. The last-minute rescue is almost as thrilling as the earlier scene in which Wyatt takes a high dive off a steep cliff into a river. Ace stuntmen Reed Howes and Yakima Canutt are prominent among the supporting players. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 52&nbsp;mins
