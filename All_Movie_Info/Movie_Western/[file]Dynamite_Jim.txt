This amusing spaghetti western from prolific director Alfonso Balcazar is set during the American Civil War. Luis Davila stars as Dynamite Jim, a Northern spy smuggling Mexican gold through Rebel territory to an Iowa fort. Jim's journey includes betrayal by a greedy cohort (Fernando Sancho), a showdown with an evil bandit (Aldo Sambrell), and other standard encounters, well-photographed by Victor Monreal. Cult-film fans will be pleased by the lovely Rosalba Neri (as a dancehall floozy) and amused by a particularly ludicrous soundtrack by Nico Fidenco. ~ Robert Firsching, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
