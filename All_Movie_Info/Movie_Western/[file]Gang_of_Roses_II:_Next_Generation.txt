The sole survivor of the original gang teams with three fearless female outlaws for a daring robbery, but cross a band of ruthless bandits with some violent plans of their own. Sweltering behind bars in a sun-scorched Mexican jail, Cassie may be down, but she certainly isn't out. She alone holds the code to a safe owned by the U.S. military, and the moment she gets out the heist is on. With the help of Kate, (Rocsi Diaz), Cassie and her fellow inmate Collette (Eurika Pratts) stage a daring escape. Later, Collette, Kate, Candi (Teyana Taylor) and Mimi (Claudia Jordan) hatch an audacious plan to rob San Juevo church, but find their heist foiled by the trigger-happy Lee (Gabriel Casseus) and his gang of outlaws. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 77&nbsp;mins
