Cowboy Millionaire is one of the last and best of George O'Brien's western vehicles at the Fox Studios. O'Brien is in charge of a dude ranch, where his newest customer is wealthy English girl Evelyn Bostock. They fall in and out of love, and soon Bostock is heading back to the British Isles. O'Brien follows her, setting British society on its ear with his no-holds-barred behavior. Cowboy Millionaire was produced by Sol Lesser, who when he wasn't busy financing westerns could be found recording the cinematic exploits of boy soprano Bobby Breen and grown-up jungle man Tarzan. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 54&nbsp;mins
