An old west outlaw makes a deal with the devil to return to earth, bringing with him all the powers of hell as he seeks infernal vengeance in the present day town of Westin. Now, the only hope for saving Westin from the horrors of the past lies with Sheriff Logan Kane (Scott Phillips), his bumbling younger brother Stuart (Robert Andrus), and comely gun shop proprietor Grace (Lillith Fields). Replete with cowboy zombies, ancient demons, and walking skeletons, this supernatural western offers six shooter thrills with a diabolic twist. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 81&nbsp;mins
