Vile is a 2011 horror film following a group of people who find themselves locked in a house for 24 hours where the only escape route is to inflict pain upon one another.

Recalling Saw, Hostel and other similar efforts, this direct-to-video horror picture concerns a group of strangers imprisoned in a house. A video begins to play, and informs them that they may escape, but must engage in sadistic and masochistic games of torture and suffering in order to do so. The crowd soon breaks into schisms, marred by secret pacts, betrayals, and horrific violence. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviSee All Vile Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
