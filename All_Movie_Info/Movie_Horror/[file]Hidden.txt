A man inherits a remote monastery-turned-experimental addiction treatment center from his late mother, and makes a horrible discovery while exploring the property with a group of friends. Brian Karter (Sean Clement) was just a young boy when his mother treated addicts at "The Sanctuary". Years later, Brian's mother has passed away, and the abandoned building becomes a monument to decay. Brian wants nothing to do with it, but his friends convince him to take a tour of the building before deciding what to do with it. When Brian and his friends stumble into a secret laboratory with a cutting edge machine capable of eradicating any form of addiction, the discovery leaves them speechless. But with each successful treatment, a new nightmare is born. Now, after decades lying dormant, the nightmares have awoken. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Hidden Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 81&nbsp;mins
