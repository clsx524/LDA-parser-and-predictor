A desperate family seeks safety in the countryside after the apocalypse, but finds themselves hunted by a mysterious, seemingly supernatural force. The city is in ruins; most of the population has perished, and it appears as if the government has completely collapsed. In order to ensure the safety of his family, one father gathers as many guns as possible, and raids a convenience store for food and supplies before setting his sights on the country. Though the father's wilderness training provides him with the skills to avoid detection from dangerous scavengers and keep his family well fed, their situation turns grim when mankind becomes the least of their worries. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 82&nbsp;mins
