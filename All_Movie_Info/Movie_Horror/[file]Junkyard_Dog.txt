A traumatized FBI agent races to save a terrified college coed from a cannibalistic serial rapist in this thriller that was inspired by actual events. Confined to an underground cell for weeks, Audra Buckman pleads with her sadistic captor to spare her a fate worse than death. Meanwhile, FBI Agent Samantha Deatherage has unearthed a series of clues that lead her to believe she can identify the killer. But with each passing hour that he continues to walk free, the risk that Audra won't live to see another day continues to grow. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Junkyard Dog Trailers and ClipsDirector(s):Kim BassWriter(s):Kim BassProducer(s):Deanna Shapiro,&nbsp;Kevin Heard,&nbsp;Kim Bass
