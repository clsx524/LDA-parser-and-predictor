A psychotic woman and her adult sons torment the new occupants of their former house in director Darren Lynn Bousman's remake of the demented Troma classic. In the wake of a botched bank robbery, three brothers race back home and learn that their mother (Rebecca De Mornay) has received a foreclosure notice. Flash-forward a couple of months, and the new owners of the home are throwing a housewarming party with a few close friends. In an instant, the brothers have taken the party guests hostage. But the real horror begins when their mother arrives. Sadistic, ferocious, and fiercely protective of her malevolent sons, she turns a happy celebration into a depraved nightmare of torture and death. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Mother's Day Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 112&nbsp;mins
