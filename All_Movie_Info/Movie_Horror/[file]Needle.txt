Ben Rutherford (Michael Dorman), a college student, inherits from his father an 18th century box, called Le Vaudou Mort.
Ben shows the box to his friends, and the very same night the box is stolen. Soon after that, his closest friends start dying in mysterious ways. Le Vaudou Mort is actually a "voodoo" machine designed as a tool for revenge. When the target's photograph is put into the box, a wax doll is created, giving the user power to kill or physically harm the represented person. A killer has started to use the device against Benâ€™s friends.
Ben, still unaware of the nature of the box and of the fact that it has been stolen, shows some picture of Le Vaudou Mort to Professor Banyon, his archaeology teacher, seeking information on the origins of the box. Professor Baynon contacts Dr. Halmanay, who provides to Ben some clues on the origins and uses of the box.
Ben and his brother Marcus (Travis Fimmel), who has not been forgiven by Ben since their father died in a car accident after a harsh discussion with him, figure out the power of the device and search for the killer.
The killer is finally revealed to be Kandi. She is seeking revenge for the death of her father, killed and robbed ten years earlier by Samuel Rutherford, Ben's father. After the murder, her mother became insane and she grew up in foster homes. Kandi is carrying out her plan to make Ben to experience the loss of his friends for no apparent reason and finally kill him. Her plans fail due to the reaction of the two brothers and Mary and she is killed by means of Le Vaudou Mort.
