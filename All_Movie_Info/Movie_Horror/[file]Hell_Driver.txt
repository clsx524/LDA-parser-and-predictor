When a toxic cloud turns the entire population of Northern Japan into hideous flesh eaters, a courageous schoolgirl ventures into forbidden territory on a mission to take down the dreaded Zombie Queen in this gruesome horror adventure from director Yoshihiro Nishimura (Tokyo Gore Police). In order to prevent the zombie plague from spreading into the southern region, the government has built a massive wall across the middle of the country. Meanwhile, the debate rages over whether the undead should be destroyed on sight, or safeguarded until a cure can be found. But if the Zombie Queen can be destroyed, the curse of the living dead will finally be broken. With an artificial heart that keeps on pumping and a chainsaw sword that never gets dull, heroic high school warrior Kika (Yumiko Hara) receives government orders to defeat the Zombie Queen and restore order to the island country. It won't be easy, but thanks to a small squadron of fearless outlaws by her side, Kika might just have what it takes to save humanity from a terrible fate. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 116&nbsp;mins
