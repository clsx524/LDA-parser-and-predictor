A young woman learns that her mother committed multiple murders while undergoing an exorcism, and she travels to Rome with a film crew on a mission to uncover the truth about that horrific incident in this found-footage-style possession shocker from director William Brent Bell. As a young girl, Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) had been led to believe that the killings were committed after her mother flew into a psychotic rage. But when Isabella finds evidence indicating that an exorcism was being conducted on her mother at the time, she enlists a film crew to follow her to Italy in search of the truth. In order to gain a better understanding of the spiritual plight that her mother endured, Isabella and her crew attend a series of unsanctioned exorcisms that become increasingly terrifying. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Devil Inside Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 83&nbsp;mins
