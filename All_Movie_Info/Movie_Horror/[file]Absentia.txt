Absentia is a 2011 horror film written and directed by Mike Flanagan. The film's principal photography phase was funded by way of the film's project page on crowd funding website Kickstarter.
Tricia's husband Daniel has been missing for seven years. Her younger sister Callie comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in absentia'. As Tricia sifts through the wreckage and tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to an ominous tunnel near the house that might also be connected to other neighborhood disappearances. Soon it becomes clear that the ancient force at work in the tunnel might have set its sights on Callie and Tricia ... and that Daniel might be suffering a fate far worse than death in its grasp.
Absentia debuted on 3 March 2011 at the Fargo Film Festival and opened in other film festivals on the dates given below.

The film was later acquired by Phase 4 Films for North American DVD and Video on Demand distribution.
Absentia earned various awards in categories ranging from recognition of the film itself to its screenplay, direction and editing, to the performance of the lead actors.

Tricia (Courtney Bell) has waited for nearly seven years to have her missing husband declared legally dead, and just as this ruling is about to be made, her sister Callie (Katie Parker) discovers that an ominous tunnel near Tricia's house might very well be a portal to a supernatural world that might be responsible for the husband's disappearance. Now the sisters must prepare, as they appear to be next in line. ~ Perry Seibert, RoviSee All Absentia Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
