A man, his girlfriend, and his gay lover arrive on a secluded island to explore a severed family tie, but soon find themselves trapped by the rising tide, with little hope of escape. Sadie suffers from hydrophobia, but her boyfriend Rick has just discovered a secret. A woman named Corrine claims to be Sadie's long lost sister, and she's invited them to Amen, a remote island with some strange traditions. Little does everyone realize that Sadie has a secret, and as she prepares to make a big revelation, Rick and his pal Jonny sneak off for some time alone. The following morning Sadie begins suffering from strange visions. As her initial reservations about Corrine appear to fade, it begins to look like escape from the island is impossible. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Unhappy Birthday Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
