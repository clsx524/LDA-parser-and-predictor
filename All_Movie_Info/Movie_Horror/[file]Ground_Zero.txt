Two body disposal specialists get more than they bargained for after collecting a frozen corpse that could unleash a terrifying zombie plague on the entire planet. Little do they realize that his particular body previously belonged to a notorious political activist who injected himself with a lethal virus before being assassinated by evil corporate hit men. Later arriving at a remote warehouse where a pair of low-level cleaners has been assigned to help them, the two professionals realize that something has gone very wrong once the corpses rise up, and the blood starts to flow. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Ground Zero Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 87&nbsp;mins
