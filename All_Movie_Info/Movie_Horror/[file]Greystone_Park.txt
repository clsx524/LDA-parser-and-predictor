Greystone Park is a found footage horror film written by Sean Stone and Alexander Wraith, directed by Sean Stone and starring Sean Stone, Alexander Wraith, Antonella Lentini, Oliver Stone and Bruce Payne.
The film is based on the true life experiences of film makers Sean Stone and Alexander Wraith. They met at a dinner with Oliver Stone when Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was being filmed in October 2009, where they started to discuss ghost stories. As a result, Sean and Alexander decided to visit an abandoned psychiatric hospital in New Jersey, famous for its radical treatment of patients with mental illness, 'to explore whether or not they believe in the supernatural'. Once inside the institution they soon discovered that they were not alone.
The working titles of the film were Graystone and SecretStone. The film was released on DVD in the UK in August 2012, under the title The Asylum Tapes, and it is due to be released in the US in October 2012. Sean Stone appeared on Alex Jones's radio show The Alex Jones Show in April 2011 to discuss the film.
A group of amateur ghost hunters break into an abandoned mental institution with a dark history, and finds fear taking hold when they become the terrified targets of otherworldly forces. Rumor has it that anyone who dares enter the Greystone Park mental hospital will lose their mind. Determined to debunk the dark myth once and for all, a group of friends enter the crumbling psychiatric hospital with the cameras rolling. Little did they realize the truth was far more terrifying than they could ever imagine. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Greystone Park Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 83&nbsp;mins
