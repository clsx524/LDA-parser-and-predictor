Brace yourself for non-stop shocks in this anthology horror film featuring six blood-curdling tales of terror. When a drug dealer passes a "Junkfood Horrorfest" tape to a drug-addicted serial killer (Calico Cooper), his career in illicit narcotics comes to a violent end. Meanwhile, the junkie and her new friend pop in the tape, and settle in for some gruesome fun. The bloodletting begins with the tale of a murderous butcher with a killer appetite. Later, a twisted nurse hires a ruthless triggerman to help lighten her workload, and a notorious pervert runs afoul of vicious skateboarders. The mayhem continues when a man discovers that his faith could be his downfall, and the gory surprises just keep on coming for those brave enough to stick around to the bitter end. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 75&nbsp;mins
