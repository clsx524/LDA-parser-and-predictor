Southern gothic horror gets a brutal makeover when a group of vacationing suburbanites discover just how deadly I can be to ignore the warning signs while camping in the country. When you're traveling through Resurrection County, it pays to mind the signs. Upon arriving in the small, backwoods town of Enoch, the curious out-of-towners discover that southern hospitality is still alive and well - at least, for the time being. Later, they make the fatal mistake of ignoring a very obvious warning, a mistake that they will all soon come to regret. In this town the locals still believe in taking an eye for an eye, and they don't discriminate between their own, and the outsiders who are only passing through. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Resurrection County Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
