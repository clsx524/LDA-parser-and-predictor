Prolific music video directors The Deka Brothers make their feature debut with this highly stylized horror film following the dark journey of Dead Dog, reluctant ghoul and servant to the ruthless Prince of Vampires. Trained by his ghoul mentor Max in the art of butchering humans, Dead Dog's primary function is to ensure that his master always has a fresh supply of precious blood - and he's been performing his duties faithfully for three decades. Just as Dead Dog becomes convinced that he'll be serving the Prince of Vampires for all eternity, however, a chance meeting with a beautiful, yet strung out junkie named Pussy Cat offers new hope for a brighter future. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 93&nbsp;mins
