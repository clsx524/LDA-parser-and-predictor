A doctor seeking to escape the stress of the city buys a new home in the country, and finds herself at the intersection of life and death as she struggles to resolve a supernatural mystery. Shortly after moving into her new home, Dr. Barbara Haughton (Robin Weigert) becomes obsessed with the Civil War soldier whose spirit refuses to rest in peace. When one of her patients at the hospital falls into a coma and dies, Dr. Haughton attempts to use his body as a vessel for the fallen soldier's spirit. She has fallen in love with the ghost, but when the patient awakens and begins to display violent tendencies, her metaphysical love affair threatens to yield disastrous consequences. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Undying Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 105&nbsp;mins
