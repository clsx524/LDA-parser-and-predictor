Dead Season (Russian: Мёртвый сезон, translit.&#160;Myortvyy sezon) is a 1968 Soviet spy film directed by Savva Kulish based on a screenplay by Aleksandr Shlepyanov and Vladimir Vajnshtok and featuring Donatas Banionis and Rolan Bykov.
In the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, desperate survivors Elvis and Tweeter flee America for the safety of a tropical island, only to find that the locals have lost their humanity, and pose an even greater danger than the flesh eaters back on familiar shores. In addition to be the first feature film shot on the Canon 7D camera, Dead Season also holds the unique distinction of being the first film shot on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico since Peter Brook's Lord of the Flies. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Dead Season Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
