A gay couple on a cross-country backpacking trip encounters a pack of hungry vampires after accepting a ride from a handsome truck driver in the midst of a sexual crisis. When night falls and the truck breaks down in a secluded junkyard, the trio locks themselves in the cab in a desperate attempt to survive until sunrise. Meanwhile, the simmering sexual tension between the three trapped men spikes to a fever pitch. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Bite Marks Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 84&nbsp;mins
