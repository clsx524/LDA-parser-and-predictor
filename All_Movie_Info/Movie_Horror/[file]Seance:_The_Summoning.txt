A group of friends finds out the hard way that dabbling in the supernatural can yield terrifying repercussions in this shocker from an executive producer of Hellraiser and Hellraiser II. Convinced that his friend has been faking her psychic abilities, Joey invites her and two others to hold a s√©ance in the city morgue. The horrors of hell are unleashed, however, when the group mistakenly summons a demon that takes possession of Joey after he panics, and breaks the sacred circle protecting them all. As the demon begins to gain power, Joey's friends realize that unless they can save their friend, they will all be doomed to eternal damnation. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
