A high school senior learns he descends from a long line of werewolves, and attempts to choose between embracing his inner-beast and holding on to his humanity as the long-running horror franchise returns. Will Kidman (Landon Liboiron) is your typical teenager; he's got an eye for girls, and lately his gaze has been lingering on a gorgeous classmate (Lindsey Shaw). Meanwhile, an enigmatic woman (Ivana Milicevic) from Will's distant past resurfaces with a shocking revelation: Will's ancestors were lycanthropes, and now he will inherit the secrets of their incredible power. But when Will realizes that embracing his destiny will spell certain death for the girl he loves, he prepares to make a choice that could spell the end of his monstrous bloodline, and incur the wrath of the very creatures that have claimed him as one of their own. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Howling Reborn Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
