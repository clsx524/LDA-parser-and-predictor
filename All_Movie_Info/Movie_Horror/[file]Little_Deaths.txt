Three bizarre tales of terror and eroticism are brought together in this thriller anthology. In House and Home, Richard (Luke de Lacey) and Victoria (Siubhan Harrison) are a couple whose marriage has gone sour, and the rare pleasure they derive from being together comes from a strange ritual they perform with unknowing and unwilling guests. However, when Richard invites a young homeless woman in for a meal and some spiritual counseling, he and Victoria find themselves in for far more than they expected. Mutant Tool stars Jodie Jameson as Jennifer, a former junkie and prostitute who is trying to stay off the streets with the help of her boyfriend Frank (Daniel Brocklebank). A doctor has prescribed Jennifer a special medication to help her deal with withdrawal, but the side effects seem almost worse than going cold turkey, and in time she learns the bizarre nature of the drug and how it's produced. And finally, Bitch concerns Pete (Tom Sawyer) and Claire (Kate Braithwaite), a couple whose relationship is defined by extreme S&M role-playing. Claire is the dominant partner and Pete is a willing bottom, but he's beginning to grow weary of Claire's treatment, and one night he turns the tables with startling results. Little Deaths was an official selection at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
