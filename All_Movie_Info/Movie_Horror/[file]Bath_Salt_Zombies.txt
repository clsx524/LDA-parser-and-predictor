Bath salt addicts bloody chaos in the streets of New York City in this gruesome independent shocker. As the American government wages war on the bath salts epidemic in the south and Midwest, black market dealers move their surpluses into the northeast, where a brilliant amateur chemist creates one of the most potent strains of the drug ever to hit the streets. But something went awry in the process, and now the tormented addicts of New York City are being transformed into rampaging flesh eaters. As their numbers rapidly multiply, the time to fight back for all of humanity draws near. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
