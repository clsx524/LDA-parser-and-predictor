In July 2012, it was announced the completed film would screen in October as part of Syfy's "31 Days of Halloween" programming block.
New York Daily News compared the film to The Walking Dead, offering that it was more bloody and grisly, and that in comparison, Rise of the Zombies "makes Walking Dead look like Dora the Explorer." They also noted the film's "remarkably accomplished cast", and of the script wrote "their lines aren't Shakespeare, but they fall into the spirit, at least until most of them get chopped in half, eaten alive or whatever." The New York Times felt that the film was "largely in the venerable horror tradition of movie-as-extended-chase-scene" and that The Walking Dead was "gentle by comparison." They wrote that the film had "credible action sequences" and that the script offered " tiny flashes of wit". 
Rise of the Zombies premiered on October 27, 2012 with 1.28 million viewers.
