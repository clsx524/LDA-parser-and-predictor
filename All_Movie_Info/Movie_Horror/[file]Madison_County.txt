The teaser trailer was released on August 18, 2010. The film was written and directed by Eric England. The film premiered at the LA Screamfest.
The film received negative reviews. Shock Till You Drop said "Madison County is not original, follows a lot of the patterns that we've seen in other clich√© horror movies and doesn't do much to distinguish itself from other entries in the genre."
Horror News.Net said "Madison County is a frustrating slasher film. It takes the standard Eighties slasher structure and executes it with precision and focus; however, it rarely takes any chances with the well worn formula which undermines the scares and tension."
Fear Net gave the film a positive review, saying "Madison County takes a while to get where it's going, but the final destination is satisfying enough."
Dread Central awarded the film 3 out of five and said "it certainly isn't a game-changing affair or anything but the film should definitely prove to be an enjoyable experience for all the indie horror loving masses out there and makes for a fun little popcorn flick for the slasher film fans as well."
A trip to a remote mountain town spells doom for a group of curious college kids researching a notorious serial killer in this bloody backwoods slasher flick. Compelled to visit Madison County after reading a book about the murderous maniac who once lived there, the curious students fail to locate the author of the gruesome tome, and get the cold shoulder from the local townspeople - who claim that no such crimes ever took place. Now the deeper the snooping tourists venture into the woods, the closer they get to the grisly truth. And once they find what they came looking for, no one will be left to confirm the legend of Madison County. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Madison County Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 82&nbsp;mins
