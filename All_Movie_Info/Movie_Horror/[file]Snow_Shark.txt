Years after a team of animal biologists vanished while exploring a rash of wildlife killings near a small town, the locals start turning up dead, sparking a wave of panic. As a result, the town is quickly overrun by curious gawkers, and sleuthing crypto zoologists. But only one man knows what the terrible creature swimming through the snow is capable of. His name is Mark. He's survived an attack by the ferocious Snow Shark once before and now he won't rest until he's caught the biggest crypto zoological mystery since Bigfoot. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 79&nbsp;mins
