Seven horror fans attend an invite-only party on a secluded farm, and awaken to find themselves in the world of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead in director Douglas Schulze's gruesome homage to the classic zombie film. Russell (Taylor Piedmonte) and Duane (Allen Maldonado) are attendees at a horror convention when they cross paths with pretty goth girl Judith (Lauren Mae Shafer) who invites them both to join her at an exclusive after-hours party. Once there, the mood quickly turns menacing. But before they can make a quick getaway, Russell and Duane are knocked out cold. Awakening in different clothes and strangely familiar surroundings, the horror fans find themselves trapped in a remote farmhouse that's under siege by the living dead. Terrified by the fact that they've seen this story before - and everyone dies - the dwindling survivors must use their knowledge of the film to find a way out of the frightening predicament. Meanwhile, anyone brave enough to try and break free from the plot gets a nasty surprise. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
