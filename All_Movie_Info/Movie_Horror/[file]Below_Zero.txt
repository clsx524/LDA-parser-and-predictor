Below Zero is a 1930 short film starring Laurel and Hardy, directed by James Parrott and produced by Hal Roach
Laurel and Hardy have no success earning money on a bleak, snowy winter's day, especially when playing In the Good Old Summertime. Their instruments are destroyed in an argument with a woman, but Stan finds a wallet. They are chased by a thief, but are protected by a police officer. Stan and Ollie share a slap-up meal with the cop, but unfortunately, Stan finds out the wallet in fact belongs to the cop. When the policeman discovers this he tells the waiter who throws them out of the restaurant and throws Stan upside down in a barrel of water. Oliver finds Stan who now has an enormous stomach after drinking all the water while trapped in the barrel.
An extended Spanish version, Tiembla Y Titubea was also produced with Laurel and Hardy speaking phonetically from blackboards placed just out of camera range; Spanish-speaking actors replacing the English supporting players.
A stressed-out screenwriter (Edward Furlong) attempts to overcome writer's block by having himself locked in the freezer of an abandoned abattoir, but finds himself unable to distinguish fantasy from reality as the serial killer he created emerges from the page to unleash bloody havoc. Michael Berryman and Kristin Booth co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Below Zero Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 98&nbsp;mins
