A Secret Service agent is forced to choose between saving his loved ones and protecting a secret he's been sworn to safeguard in this thriller starring Stephen Dorff. After awakening completely disoriented and restrained, Jeremy Reins (Dorff) watches helplessly as a digital countdown edges ever closer to zero. Outside, it begins to sound as if society has collapsed. His captors want to know the location of the president's secret underground bunker, and they're willing to kill in order to get an answer. Unless Reins gives it to them, everyone he cares about will soon die. As the conflicted agent weighs his responsibilities, the clock keeps counting down. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Brake Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
