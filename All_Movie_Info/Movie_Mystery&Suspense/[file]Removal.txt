A man struggling with his sanity is being pushed to the brink by visions of violence and death in this psychological thriller from first time director Nick Simon. Cole (Mark Kelly) is a guy wrestling with more than his share of troubles -- after losing his white collar job, he's been reduced to working for a cleaning service and has developed a dependence on pain medication that causes him to hallucinate, all of which is putting a serious strain on his marriage. Cole also hasn't felt especially stable since he saw his friend Eric (Billy Burke) murder his family and then turn the gun on himself. Near the end of a busy week, Cole's boss persuades him to take on one more assignment: Henry Sharpe (Oz Perkins) is a wealthy man who wants his mansion cleaned before he shows it to prospective buyers. While it would normally take a small crew a few days to fully clean the big house, Henry offers Cole $5,000 in cash to do the job in one night. That's more than Cole can afford to turn down, but over the course of the night Henry keeps dropping hints that something sinister has happened in his mansion, and Cole isn't sure if he's cleaning up a murder scene or letting his imagination get the better of him again. Removal also features Elliott Gould, Emma Caulfield and Kelly Brook. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
