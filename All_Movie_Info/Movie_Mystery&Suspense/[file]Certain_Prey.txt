This tense thriller from director Chris Gerolmo stars Mark Harmon as Deputy Chief of Police Lucas Davenport. He's called to the scene after a cop gets shot in cold blood for witnessing the murder of an attorney's wife. Initially, Davenport's team pins a double homicide on the lawyer, but then several FBI agents arrive, and link the policeman's death to an enigmatic hired killer named Clara Rinker (Tatiana Maslany). However, as Davenport digs deeper and deeper into the case, he concludes that she, in turn, is linked to yet another party - a corrupt attorney named Carmel Loan (Lola Glaudini-Blow). Davenport then begins assembling evidence to put these two women away. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 120&nbsp;mins
