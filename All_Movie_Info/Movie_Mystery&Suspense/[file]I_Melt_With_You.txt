Four friends come together for a reunion that leads them down a self-destructive path in this drama. Jonathan (Rob Lowe), Richard (Thomas Jane), Ron (Jeremy Piven), and Tim (Christian McKay) are four men in their mid-forties who have known each other since they went to college together. Each year, they reunite for a vacation, renting a beach house in California and engaging in as much drug- and alcohol-fueled carousing as they can tolerate. While they seem happy on the surface, in truth all four are deeply troubled; Jonathan is a doctor whose specialty is writing prescriptions for the right price, Richard is a teacher still mourning his unsuccessful career as a novelist, Ron is a commodities trader in trouble with the law, and Tim feels lost and purposeless in his life. Over the course of their holiday, the friends will be touched by an unexpected tragedy and shocked by revelations that change the way they view one another. Also starring Carla Gugino and Sasha Grey, I Melt With You was an official selection at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All I Melt With You Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 116&nbsp;mins
