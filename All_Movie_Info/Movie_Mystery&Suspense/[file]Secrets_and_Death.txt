Her protective father will stop at nothing to protect his bloodline, but he may already be too late -- his only child and sole heir is now carrying a baby with an insanity gene! A murder plot is just the beginning of the mayhem that ensues in this compelling and explosive interracial love story. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 85&nbsp;mins
