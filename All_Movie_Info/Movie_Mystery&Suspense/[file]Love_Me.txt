A prep school student falls for a mysterious new transfer who becomes the prime suspect in a missing persons case, and begins to fear for her life when all evidence indicates he killed the girl that the entire town has been searching for. Three months after Melissa Kennedy vanished without a trace, the residents of Ridgedale are still searching for answers. Meanwhile, Hampton Prep student Sylvia Potter (Lindsey Shaw) has fallen hard for handsome new arrival Lucas Green (Jamie Johnston), a troubled teen who has just transferred in from another school. Just as the two teens enter into a whirlwind romance, however, the local police begin to focus their investigation on Lucas. Is Lucas really the person responsible for abducting - and possibly murdering - Melissa Kennedy, or has someone in this tight-knit town finally found the perfect fall guy for their heinous crime? ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Love Me Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
