A New York City teen is placed in the witness protection program after seeing her parents killed and testifying against the son of a vicious gangster, but realizes that her life is still in danger when a ruthless hit man discovers her secret identity. When Alicia Torres (Ana Villafa√±e) turned evidence against one of the most feared mobsters in New York City, the government gave her a new identity and sent her to live in Longview, Montana. Enrolling in a new school under the name Josephine Russo, Alicia finds adjusting to the new environment especially difficult as sensitive artist Jesse (Tyler Blackburn) and popular athlete Brett (Jeremy Sumpter) vie for her affections. Meanwhile, a resourceful hired killer has just tracked Alicia down, and he's determined to silence the young witness once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
