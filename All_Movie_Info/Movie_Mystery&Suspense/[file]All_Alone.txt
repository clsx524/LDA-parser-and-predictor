A camping trip into the wilderness turns treacherous for a neglected urban housewife who seeks to reevaluate her life in the peace of the country. Each day Maggie spends in Los Angeles is another day she retreats further into herself. Ignored by her husband Ben and convinced that their marriage is crumbling, she ventures into the mountains with her two friends Alex and Kyle in hope of having some time to reflect. Deep in the forest, they cross paths with Birch, an extreme environmentalist who quickly forges a strong bond with conflicted nature photographer Maggie. Meanwhile, when tensions spike and everyone's true colors are revealed, it becomes apparent that not everyone will make it out of the woods alive. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All All Alone Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 86&nbsp;mins
