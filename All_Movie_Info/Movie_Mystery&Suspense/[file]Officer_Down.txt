A crooked cop gets a second chance to go straight, but finds his shady past returning with a vengeance while tracking the violent thugs who are brutalizing the dancers at a local strip club. It's been a whole year since Detective Callahan (Stephen Dorff) was rescued by a stranger during a drug bust gone awry. Ever since that day, the detective has worked hard to clean up his reputation. But his life changes forever when that mystery hero emerges from the shadows to request a favor. The local strippers have recently fallen prey to a group of men who believe they are above the law. In order to bring them to justice, Detective Calahan must take caution not to reveal how his own previous actions helped to enable the perpetrators. Now the closer Detective Callahan comes to getting his men, the more he risks revealing the past misdeeds that he has worked so hard to cover up since cheating death, and turning over a new leaf. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Officer Down Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
