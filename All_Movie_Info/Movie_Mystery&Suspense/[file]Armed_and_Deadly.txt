Haunted Gulf War veteran Janis Mckenzie (Lisa Varga) keeps people at arm's length after returning home from active duty and losing the love of her life, but finds that her greatest fight is yet to come. As a teenager, Janis watched helplessly as her twin brother Jamey (Kennth Stellingwerf) killed their parents in cold blood. 20 years later, Jamey is about to get out of prison. He's vowed to kill his sister as soon as he's released, and now as Janis struggles to bury her darkened past, death comes knocking on her door. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Armed and Deadly Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
