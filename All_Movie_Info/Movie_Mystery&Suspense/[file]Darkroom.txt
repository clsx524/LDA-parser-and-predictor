A married couple that develops crime scene photos for the Salt Lake Police Department gradually finds the psychic toll of their job becoming too much to bear as the disturbing content of the pictures begins to weigh heavily on their morale and cast a suffocating blanket of melancholy over their very existence. Every day, David and Coy are reminded just how badly life can end. When David suffers a devastating disconnect from reality and Coy experiences serious complications while attempting to get pregnant, both of their lives begin spiraling down the same dark and dangerous path. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Darkroom Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 94&nbsp;mins
