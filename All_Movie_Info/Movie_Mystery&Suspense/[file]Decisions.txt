Financial desperation leads to bad decisions for a group of friends seeking to lie, cheat, and steal their way out of debt. When their bid to make a quick buck goes hopelessly awry, a corrupt detective (Corey Haim in his final role) emerges guns blazing in an attempt to get the money back to the gangsters it was stolen from. Now, the choices that everyone makes in the next 24 hours will be the ones they'll have to live with for the rest of their lives - which may not be very long. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 87&nbsp;mins
