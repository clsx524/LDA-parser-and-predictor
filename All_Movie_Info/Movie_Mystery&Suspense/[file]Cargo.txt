A pretty Russian model falls prey to human traffickers, and fights to escape while being smuggled from the Mexico border to New York City. As her growing desperation begins to make an impression on the austere Egyptian transporter hired to drive her across the U.S., both realize what their lives are really worth. Meanwhile, the ruthless traffickers remain determined to see their cargo delivered without incident. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Cargo Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 86&nbsp;mins
