Allegiance is a 2012 American war film directed by Michael Connors, produced by Sandra Bullock, starring Bow Wow. Allegiance takes place in October 2004 and concerns the deployment of a New York Army National Guard unit to Iraq.
In October 2004, as one lieutenant of a New York Army National Guard unit obtains a transfer through his politically powerful father, questions arise over the cancellation of a leave for an enlisted combat medic with a sick son. The loyalties of the soldiers to each other and the country become the topic of a drama unfolding primarily through words and actions.
As his National Guard unit prepares for deployment in Iraq, Lieutenant Danny Sefton (Seth Gabel) finds his loyalty to the military challenged when he's asked to aid a fellow soldier in going AWOL so the man can care for his critically ill son. Shad "Bow Wow" Moss and Aidan Quinn co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Allegiance Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
