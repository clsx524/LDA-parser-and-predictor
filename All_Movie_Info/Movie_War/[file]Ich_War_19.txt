In this propaganda film that embraces pacifism, a German boy of 19 moves to Russia with his parents. He comes upon the body of a German woman who has willfully killed herself to avoid being captured by the Russians. In an incredible sequence of events, Germans take up arms against SS troops towards the end of the war. The young man liberates a concentration camp before deciding that war is futile. ~ Dan Pavlides, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 115&nbsp;mins
