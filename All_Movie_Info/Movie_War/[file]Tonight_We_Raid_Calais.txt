Tonight We Raid Calais is a 1943 American film directed by John Brahm.
John Sutton plays a young commando officer inserted into occupied France, assisted by a farming family whose beautiful daughter falls for him, then betrays him to the Nazi officials.
A timely film when first released in 1943, Tonight We Raid Calais survives as an entertaining adventure some fifty years later. John Sutton plays a British intelligence officer, sent into occupied France with a small unit to local a German munitions depot. While travelling under cover of darkness, Sutton confronts a French maiden (Annabella) who hates the British and the Germans with equal fervor. She eventually determines which side is the right side and allows Sutton to continue his mission. The officer is captured by the Nazis, but his comrades locate the munitions plant and notify the Allied bombers. The screenplay for Tonight We Raid Calais was written by future blacklistee Waldo Salt, whose liberal stance was politically correct during wartime but considered a "no no" once peace was declared. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 70&nbsp;mins
