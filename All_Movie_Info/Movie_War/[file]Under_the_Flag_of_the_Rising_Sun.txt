Under the Flag of the Rising Sun (軍旗はためく下に, Gunki hatameku moto ni?) is a 1972 Japanese film directed by Kinji Fukasaku. The film was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 45th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
The quest of a war-widow for the truth about her husband's death during World War II serves as the backbone for this film, which portrays the Japanese militarism of that time and the attitudes which gave rise to it. Though the government labelled her husband as a deserter, his widow does not believe it, and every day she makes a trip to the war reparations office until she finally tracks down four men who knew her husband in his last days. They tell a harrowing story of the breakdown of humanity at the close of the war. ~ Clarke Fountain, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
