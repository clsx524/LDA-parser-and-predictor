Five American soldiers race to foil a diabolical Nazi plot to destabilize the U.S. economy in this period war adventure from director Jean Libert√©. In an effort to throw the Allies off balance, the Nazis are preparing to enact "Operation Bernhard", a plan that involves pumping millions in counterfeit bills into the American economy. The money is currently hidden deep in Nazi-occupied Europe. But as a brave squadron of Allied soldiers venture behind enemy lines to destroy the bills, the greed of man puts the future of America at risk. Now, with the Nazis closing in fast, everything starts to fall apart. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Spoils of War Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 87&nbsp;mins
