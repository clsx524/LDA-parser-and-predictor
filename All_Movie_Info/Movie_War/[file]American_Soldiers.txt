A routine sortie turns into a struggle for survival for a U.S. patrol on assignment in Iraq in director Sidney J. Furie's action packed war film. They've gone through training, and now these young soldiers will be forced to put everything they learned in boot camp to the ultimate test when Fedayeen fighters with superior knowledge of the local landscape engage them in close quarters combat of the deadliest kind. With their ammunition dwindling and hope for back-up fading fast, the only thing keeping these desperate soldiers going is pure survival instinct. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 93&nbsp;mins
