The Boat Is Full (German: Das Boot ist voll) is a 1981 German-language Swiss film directed by Markus Imhoof.
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film as a Swiss submission. It was also entered into the 31st Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement.
The title of the film derives from what was expressed by the Swiss during World War II, for as a nonbelligrent country many refugees deired entry there, with most being denied permission. They were frequently told, "Our boat is full," a reference to passengers of a lifeboat after a ship sinking frequently refusing to allow any further survivors to enter their craft after it had reached a level of occupancy felt to approach the limit of safety.
Based on fact, The Boat is Full is set during World War II. A group of Jewish refugees desperately attempt to escape to the safety of neutral Switzerland. The problem: too many refugees, and too little room in the boat commissioned for the trip. Director Markus Imhoof is neither a polished nor a subtle filmmaker, nor is the acting of the highest calibre. This hardly matters: the intensity and sincerity of everyone involved in The Boat is Full compensates for any and all production crudities. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 104&nbsp;mins
