"Project Enigma" was designed to crack the Nazi secret code machine during World War II. Historically, the success of this mission has been attributed to the British. Enigma Secret reveals Poland's role in this crucial turn of events. Three Polish math whizzes pool their skills to break the code, and, incidentally, to stay alive long enough to complete their task. Tadeusz Borowski, Piotr Fronczewski and Piotr Garlicki star in this intelligently constructed, fact-based war story. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 158&nbsp;mins
