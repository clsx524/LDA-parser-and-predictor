Set during the Russian Civil War of the 1920s, Two Comrades Were Serving follows two soldiers, one of whom was formerly a photographer, who use a newly acquired French camera to capture images of enemy fortifications from the air. What sounds like a relatively easy mission turns into a war-time adventure that neither of them will forget. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 99&nbsp;mins
