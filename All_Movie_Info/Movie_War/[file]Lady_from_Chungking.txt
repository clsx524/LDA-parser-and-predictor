The Lady from Chungking is a 1942 American War film.
The film tells the story of an aristocratic Chinese woman leading a group of Chinese fighters against Japan during World War II.
Alpha Video released the film on region-1 DVD on May 31, 2005.
Though cheaply produced in the time-honored tradition of PRC Productions, The Lady from Chungking was nothing if not timely. Anna May Wong heads the cast as Kwan Mei, the aristocratic leader of a band of Chinese partisans. Operating secretly, Kwan Mei's compatriots wage vicious guerilla warfare against the occupying Japanese troops. The oddly chosen supporting cast includes Harold Huber as a Japanese general and Mae Clarke as White Russian patriot; the nominal leading men, are pair of downed Flying Tigers pilots, are played by general-purpose actors Ric Vallin and Paul Bryar. The second of Anna May Wong's films for PRC, The Lady From Chungking was a distinct step down from the first, Bombs over Burma, which benefited from the directorial knowhow of Joseph H. Lewis. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 68&nbsp;mins
