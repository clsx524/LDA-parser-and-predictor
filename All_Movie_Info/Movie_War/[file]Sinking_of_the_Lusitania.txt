Documentary filmmaker Christopher Spencer uncovers the truth about the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in this film that gets to the heart of the mystery by leaving no theory unexplored. May 17, 1915: The RMS Lusitania, a luxury cruise-liner, is carrying 1900 passengers when a German torpedo suddenly strikes just beneath the ship's bridge. In the eighteen minutes that it took the Lusitania to sink, 1200 passengers and crewmembers perished at sea. In the aftermath of the sinking, numerous conspiracy theories began to emerge: Was the British government secretly using a passenger ship to transport explosives? Had Winston Churchill sacrificed the ship in order to draw America into a war she had been reluctant to join? Now, nearly a century later, the facts are separated from the fiction as Spencer and his researchers sort through the details on a painstaking quest to finally raise the truth up from the depths. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 85&nbsp;mins
