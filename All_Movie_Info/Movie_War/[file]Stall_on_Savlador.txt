Polish resistance fighters battle against Nazi occupation during World War II. A key rebel leader is arrested by the Gestapo and tortured by his captors. His girlfriend has also been captured when it is revealed she is protecting a Jewish girl from falling into the hands of the Germans. The leader does his best to give misleading information to the enemy in order to save his cohorts from a similar fate. A young Nazi soldier is ordered to execute the rebel, but is torn between his orders and his morals. ~ Dan Pavlides, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 79&nbsp;mins
