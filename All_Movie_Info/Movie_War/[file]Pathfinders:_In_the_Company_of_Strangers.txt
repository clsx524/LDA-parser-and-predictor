With little time to prepare and no support once they've landed on the ground, the fearless paratroopers must avoid the German infantry while locating the ideal site for the equipment. The job won't be easy but should they succeed, the tide of the entire war will be turned in the Allies favor, striking a crucial blow against their enemies, and paving the path to ultimate victory.
