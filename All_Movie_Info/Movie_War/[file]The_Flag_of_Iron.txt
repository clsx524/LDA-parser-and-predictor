When a loyal member of a crime syndicate volunteers to take the heat off his gang and go into temporary exile after a volatile conflict with a rival clan, the young warrior finds that his sacrifice isn't honored in this historical kung fu epic. Upon returning from his stint as a scapegoat, Iron Panther finds that his gang has joined with the enemy gang his comrades were fighting when he left. With the help of two other fighters, Iron Panther must now mount a fearless effort to win back the honor that was lost, culminating in a fantastical display of skill in a battle fought with flag-draped spears. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviComplete Cast of The Flag of IronPhilip KwokChiang ShengDirector(s):Chang ChehWriter(s):Ni Kuang,&nbsp;Chang ChehCategories:War,&nbsp;Action  AdventureLooking for special editions of The Flag of Iron?See All Versions
