Minesweeper is a 1943 American film directed by William Berke.


Adhering to the formula of such previous Pine-Thomas productions as Forced Landing, Flying Blind and Torpedo Boat, Minesweeper is the action-packed story of military men under wartime pressure. Richard Arlen plays Jim Smith, a once-reliable Naval officer who has virtually destroyed his life with his chronic gambling. When Pearl Harbor is attacked, Smith finds a chance for redemption. He signs up under an assumed name as a lowly seaman, then proves that he's still made of "the right stuff" by single-handedly seeking out and destroying a new type of Japanese mine. Jean Parker, who like Arlen was a "regular" in the Pine-Thomas product, plays Smith's loyal wife Mary, while the requisite romantic-rival duties are handled by western alumnus Russell Hayden. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 66&nbsp;mins
