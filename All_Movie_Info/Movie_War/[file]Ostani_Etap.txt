The Last Stop (original Polish title: Ostatni Etap) explores in excruciating detail the treatment of women inmates in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. The film is nearly impossible to watch at times; surely, you'll try (but fail) to tell yourself, no civilized nation was capable of such bestiality. Most of the story is told from the point of view of Michelle (Huguette Faget), who finally escapes the camp, more dead than alive. The fact that the film was produced only a few years after Auschwitz was liberated adds to the gruesome immediacy of the tale. The Last Stop was written by Wanda Jakubowska and Gerda Schneider--both of whom were Auschwitz survivors. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 105&nbsp;mins
