Attack on Leningrad, or just Leningrad, is a 2009 war film written and directed by Aleksandr Buravsky, set during the Siege of Leningrad.
In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and their troops besieged the city of Leningrad. Foreign journalists are evacuated but one of them, Kate Davis (Mira Sorvino), is presumed dead and misses the plane. Alone in the city she is helped by Nina Tsvetkova (Olga Sutulova) a young and idealist police officer and together they fight for their own and other people's survival.
Director Aleksandr Buravsky revisits the Nazi siege of Leningrad through the eyes of a British journalist being targeted by the KGB in this sweeping historical drama. The year is 1941. As Hitler's forces take hold of Leningrad, UK war correspondent Kate Davis (Mira Sorvino) finds herself trapped in the city, and desperate to reunite with her lover Philip Parker (Gabriel Byrne), a U.S. journalist. As death shadows her every move, Kate befriends local militia woman Nina Tsvetkova and a pair of Russian children. Only with their help can Kate hope to make it out of this nightmare scenario alive. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Leningrad Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 110&nbsp;mins
