Oscar-nominated filmmaker Whit Stillman (The Last Days of Disco) returns to the director's chair for the first time in 13 years with this comedy set at an East Coast university and centering on the trials of four female undergrads who seek to make life better for the entire student body. Violet Wister (Greta Gerwig) is a natural-born leader. Together with the help of her conscientious friend Rose (Megalyn Echikunwoke) and their gorgeous pal Heather (Carrie MacLemore), Violet uses aroma and musical therapy to help her possibly suicidal classmates. When newly arrived transfer student Lily (Analeigh Tipton) seeks admission into their social circle, she's welcomed with open arms. While Lily appreciates having a group to be a part of, she soon realizes that Violet may not be a flawless friend. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Damsels in Distress Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 99&nbsp;mins
