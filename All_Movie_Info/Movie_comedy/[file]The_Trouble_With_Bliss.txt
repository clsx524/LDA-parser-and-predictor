Disillusioned and dead broke, apathetic New Yorker Morris Bliss (Michael C. Hall) begins to view the ever-widening cracks in his life as potential paths to escape his stagnant existence. Thirty-five and still floundering, Morris lives with his widowed father (Peter Fonda) in a cramped New York apartment. With no job to speak of, he can't raise the cash to visit all the places he's dreamt of visiting, but lately his love life has taken an intriguing twist. As his relationship with the teenage daughter (Brie Larson) of an old high-school friend threatens to blow up in his face, Morris also begins a tenuous romance with his sexy neighbor (Lucy Liu), who doesn't mince words when revealing what she really wants in a man. Just when it seems like Morris' life can't get any more complicated, he begins to recognize that he's finally being presented with a unique opportunity for real change. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Trouble With Bliss Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
