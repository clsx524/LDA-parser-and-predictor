One man will dance to win justice for his people in this offbeat satiric comedy from directors Jason Trost and Brandon Trost. Frazier Park is a tough town dominated by street gangs who recognize only one way of settling their differences -- Beat Beat Revelation, a video game that puts a player's dance skills to the test. BTRO (Brandon Barrera) is a longtime BBR champion who is challenged to prove his skills by the unscrupulous L Dubba E (Lee Valmassy). L Dubba E doesn't believe in fair play, so much so that he doesn't just win the match, he leaves BTRO dead on the ground. This is more than BTRO's brother JTRO (Jason Trost) can stand, and he sets out to become the best BBR dancer in Frazier Park and avenge his brother's passing. Turning to BBR expert BLT (Nick Principe) for help, JTRO trains as if his life depends on it -- and up against L Dubba E, that might just be the case. A broad but straight-faced satire of sports comedies of the 1980s, The FP received its world premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 83&nbsp;mins
