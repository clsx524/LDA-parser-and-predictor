Dumped by his girlfriend, given the boot by his bandmates, and fired from his soul-sucking real-estate job, depressed musician Alex (writer/director Ryan O'Nan) forms a quirky duo with devoted fan Jim (Michael Weston) and embarks on an impromptu cross-country concert tour. But after their inept manager Cassidy (Arielle Kebbel) disappears at the worst time imaginable, Alex bails to crash with his older brother (Andrew McCarthy) and reconcile his own goals against the ones being projected on him by everyone else. Also featuring Jason Ritter, Melissa Leo, and Christopher McDonald. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Brooklyn Brothers Beat the Best Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
