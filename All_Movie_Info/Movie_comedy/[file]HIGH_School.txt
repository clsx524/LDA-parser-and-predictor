A straight-laced high-school valedictorian schemes to get the entire senior class stoned in order to circumvent his principal's mandatory drug-testing policy. Henry Burke (Matt Bush) is the kind of teenager every parent dreams about having; he never ditches school, gets straight A's, and he's secured a college scholarship to pay for his higher education. Unfortunately there's just one thing standing in between Henry and his bright future -- his high-school principal. An uptight authoritarian with a hard-line anti-marijuana stance, Principal Gordon (Michael Chiklis) announces that the entire senior class will undergo mandatory drug testing, and anyone who refuses will be immediately expelled. Henry has just danced with Mary Jane for the very first time, and now his entire future is on the line thanks to a few innocent tokes. But Henry is a bright kid, and when he and local pothead Travix Breaux (Sean Marquette) put their heads together, they come up with a brilliant plan to subvert the testing policy: if they can just get every student in school stoned, Principal Gordon's plan to crucify his pot-loving charges will go completely up in smoke. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All HIGH School Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 100&nbsp;mins
