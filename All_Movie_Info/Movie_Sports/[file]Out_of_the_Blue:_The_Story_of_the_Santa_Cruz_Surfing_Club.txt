This documentary takes a look at the history of the surfing community in the secluded area of Santa Cruz, where some LA transplants going to school in San Jose in the 1930's began braving the cold waters in search of a better wave. Soon, locals were taking up the sport as well, soon inspiring an entire niche community - one that would soon be rocked by the events of World War II. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
