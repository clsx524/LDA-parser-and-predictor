Kings of the Road (German: Im Lauf der Zeit) is a 1976 German road movie directed by Wim Wenders. It was the third part of Wenders' "Road Movie Trilogy" which included Alice in the Cities (1974) and The Wrong Move (1975). It was the unanimous winner of the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.
The film is about a projection-equipment repair mechanic named Bruno Winter (Rüdiger Vogler) and a depressed hitchhiker Robert Lander (Hanns Zischler) who has just been through a break-up with his wife and a half-hearted suicide attempt. They travel along the Western side of the East-German border in a repair truck, visiting worn-out movie theaters. The movie contains many long shots without dialogue, and it was filmed in black and white by long-time Wenders collaborator Robby Müller.
Film Critic Derek Malcolm ranked Kings of the Road 89 on his list of his 100 favourite movies. Malcolm says that Wenders "achieves a palpable sense of time, place and atmosphere, and of how everybody is affected by their tiny spot in history."

This inspiring documentary follows the story of the hockey team the Portland Buckaroos, a new team that emerged on the scene in the 1950's with zero expectations by the media, but still rose to become league champions and division leaders between 1960 and 1974, legendarily drawing over 10,000 fans to Portland's Memorial Coliseum. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
