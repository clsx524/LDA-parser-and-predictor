Viewers needing to tone up their entire lower body, as well as their buttocks, thighs, and upper legs, should get this video. Tamilee Webb presents a series of exercises that are best attempted by those who aren't too challenged by somewhat complicated aerobic steps and routines. A variety of exercises are presented that will firm up numerous muscle groups. Those wanting a more demanding workout will particularly enjoy the segment on resistance training that requires the use of weights and bands. These exercises should just be done by those who have already been working out a bit since a fair amount of soreness may result if the entire routine is followed on the first try by a beginner. ~ Elizabeth Smith, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 40&nbsp;mins
