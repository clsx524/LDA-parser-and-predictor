This is the original abs workout video that started the craze. Instructor Tamilee Webb leads this intense video, which includes  three ten-minute routines which concentrate on the abdominal muscles. Best when used to supplement your regular aerobics workout, this video is not recommended for beginners. ~ Heather M. Fierst, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 39&nbsp;mins
