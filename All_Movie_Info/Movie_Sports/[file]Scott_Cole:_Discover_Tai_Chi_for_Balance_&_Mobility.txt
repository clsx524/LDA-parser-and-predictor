Tai Chi instructor and fitness expert Scott Cole leads this instructive program, designed to help all viewers, especially the elderly, or injured, achieve increased balance and stability through the slow, flowing movements of Tai Chi. The program also features Claire Karstadt, an older practitioner of the program who had "lost hope" for maintaining balance, but gained renewed ability through her use of Cole's program. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 35&nbsp;mins
