With diabetes and obesity in America's youth skyrocketing, Tai Chi expert Scott Cole offers a fun and involving alternative to sitting in front of the television in this release that aims to get kids excited about personal fitness. It's not just about a change in diet, but inspiring healthy choices that will last a lifetime. In addition to cardiovascular exercises, conditioning, and stretching, Cole also offers an introduction to such non violent martial arts as Tai Chi, yoga balance moves, and group exercises designed to build trust and sharpen social interaction skills. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 67&nbsp;mins
