Surprised to learn she has gotten pregnant following a brief affair, a classical music critic carries her baby to term for a friend who's been struggling with infertility, but finds things getting unexpectedly complicated in this emotionally-charged drama. Nora (Laura Leighton) never planned on becoming a mother, so when a fling with popular country music singer Jamie (Antonio Cupo) leaves her with child, she promises the baby to her barren best friend. At first it seems like the ideal solution, but the plan falls apart when her friend's husband walks away from the marriage. Now pregnant and alone, Nora tracks down Jamie in order to get the signature that will allow him to put up their child for adoption. When Jamie discovers that he is about to become a father, however, the pair begins to wonder if they can actually make love work. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
