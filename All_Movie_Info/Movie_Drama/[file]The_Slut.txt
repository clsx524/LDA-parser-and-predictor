A promiscuous single mother from a secluded village finds her sordid lifestyle challenged by a stranger who shows her a more meaningful human connection in this intimate Hebrew-language drama. Tamar resides in a tiny rural hamlet with her two daughters. With no husband to make her feel wanted she seeks fulfillment through lust-fueled one-night stands. But that changes when Tamar meets Shai, a handsome young man in the process of settling his late mother's estate. As Tamar and Shai develop a bond that reaches beyond the physical, the lonely mother begins to realize that random sex with strangers is no substitute for genuine love. Together, they each prepare to embark on a new phase in life where emotional fulfillment takes precedence over instant physical gratification. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Slut Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 86&nbsp;mins
