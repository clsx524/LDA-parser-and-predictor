Flik Royale is a thirteen-year old boy from Atlanta who is sent to live with his preacher grandfather, Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse, in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
Director Spike Lee reprised his role as Mookie, the main character from his 1989 film Do the Right Thing. This marked the first time that Lee has acted in one of his films since Summer of Sam (1999).
Peter Debruge of Variety said "It's fiery, passionate stuff, at times inelegantly presented, but impossible to ignore."
An Atlanta adolescent experiences a new side of life while spending the summer in Brooklyn with his grandfather, a fire-and-brimstone preacher who's determined to save his soul. Young Flik (Jules Brown) has never met his grandfather before now, and when his mother drops him off at the Red Hook housing project, the culture shock is overpowering. Depressed at the prospect of spending his cherished vacation without his friends while enduring the righteous ramblings of his grandpa Enoch (Clarke Peters), Flik resigns himself to a summer of boredom until he crosses paths with Chazz (Toni Lysaith), a spunky church girl with a unique outlook on life. Meanwhile, as the summer heat spikes and conflicts among the congregation ignite, Flik realizes that his summer vacation is about to get interesting. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Red Hook Summer Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 121&nbsp;mins
