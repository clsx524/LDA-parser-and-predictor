A widowed mother seeks justice after her teenage daughter is driven to suicide by her classmates in this drama from the makers of Accused at 17. Lexi is a shy teen who's never had much luck with boys. When star football player Greg asks Lexi on a date, her mother Michelle hopes that perhaps her social life is beginning to turn around. But Greg only asked Lexi out to win a bet with his friends, and videotapes their sexual encounter for the amusement of his friends. When Greg's spiteful ex-girlfriend Carleigh sends the video to everyone at their school, devastated Lexi takes her own life. Now, Michelle won't rest until the teens who literally bullied her daughter to death pay for their reprehensible crime. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Betrayed at 17 Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 88&nbsp;mins
