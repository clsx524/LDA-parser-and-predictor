A progressive-minded Irish priest finds his influence on his small congregation slipping, and opens a movie theater after being turned down for a reappointment to Rome in the 1950s. Father Barry (Martin Sheen) has his sights on the Vatican when influential Bishop Hegarty (Tom Hickey) announces a plan to build a series of opulent churches all across Ireland. Uneasy about the proposal yet unwilling to question his superior, Father Barry decides that the best way to raise funds quickly is to open a local movie theater which he dubs the Stella Cinema. When word gets out that Father Barry is exposing the devoutly religious locals to Hollywood immorality, however, a massive controversy turns the small town upside down. Stephen Rea co-stars. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Stella Days Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
