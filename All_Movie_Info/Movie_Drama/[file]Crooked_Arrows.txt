Crooked Arrows is a 2012 film directed by Steve Rash and written by Brad Riddell.
Crooked Arrows is a story centered on a Native American lacrosse team making its way through a prep school league tournament.

A multiracial Native American connects with his proud heritage by coaching his reservation's scrappy lacrosse team to the state finals in this inspirational sports drama starring Brandon Routh. Joe Logan (Routh) wants to give his reservation a modern makeover. But the locals don't trust him, and they're happy with the way things have always been. Meanwhile Joe's father, the Tribal Chairman, senses that his son has lost his way. In order to get him back on the right path, Joe's father puts him in charge of the reservation's high school lacrosse team on the eve of a big match against their most fierce rivals. When Joe proves a better coach than anyone could have anticipated, his team soon realizes that they may have a chance of beating their most fierce rivals - an athletically-gifted prep school team - in the annual championship game. In the process, cynical Joe learns that some traditions are worth holding onto. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Crooked Arrows Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 105&nbsp;mins
