A pot-smoking teen from an unstable background finds difficulty adjusting to life at an East Coast prep school despite maintaining a high GPA and excelling as an athlete. Raised by his single, New Age mother after his father abandons the family, 15-year-old Ellis Whitman (Graham Phillips) gains most of his wisdom from a marijuana-growing goat herder nicknamed Goat Man (David Duchovny). Later, upon enrolling in a renowned prep school, Ellis realizes he hasn't been given the proper tools to adjust to his new surroundings. Exceedingly smart and athletically gifted, Ellis gradually begins to grasp the concept of responsibility while contending with adults who place the utmost emphasis on personal accountability. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Goats Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 94&nbsp;mins
