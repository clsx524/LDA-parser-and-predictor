A desperate thief has just 12 hours to steal $10 million and save his daughter from his vengeful former partner in this fast-paced action thriller reuniting Nicolas Cage and director Simon West (Con Air, The Expendables 2). Determined to get the payout for a major heist gone awry, a degenerate criminal (Josh Lucas) kidnaps the daughter (Sami Gayle) of his one-time partner-in-crime (Cage), and threatens her life if he doesn't have the money in 12 hours. Now, with the clock ticking and his daughter trapped in a random taxi being driven around New Orleans, the frantic ex-con enlists the help of a former associate (Malin Akerman) to help pull off the heist that will save his little girl's life. Danny Huston and M.C. Gainey also star. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Stolen Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 96&nbsp;mins
