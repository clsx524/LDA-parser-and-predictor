A wise church youth group leader uses the Old Testament story of Hosea to break through to a troubled teen in this Christian-themed drama starring Sean Astin. When Stuart (Astin) and his wife Beth (Erin Bethea lead a group of teens on a weekend camping trip, self-absorbed misfit Ashley experiences difficulty fitting in. In response, she's ostracized by the group. Sensing an opportunity to convey the importance of unconditional love to his young charges, Stuart shares Hosea's story and finds that even the Good Book's oldest tales still hold wisdom thousands of years after they were written. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Amazing Love Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
