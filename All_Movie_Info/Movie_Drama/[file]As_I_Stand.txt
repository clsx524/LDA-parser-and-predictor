Inquisitive young adults Devin and Matthew are seeking the answers to life's most difficult questions when they both set down conflicting life paths in this Christian-themed drama from producerdirector Carlo Nicoletta. As Devin falls back in his faith for the power to face the difficult challenges ahead, Matthew's growing frustration causes him to constantly seek a scapegoat for every little problem. Later, when both men are challenged to love God and expect nothing in return, their answers reveal their true natures. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 104&nbsp;mins
