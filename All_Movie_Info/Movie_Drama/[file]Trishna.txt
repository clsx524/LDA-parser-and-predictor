It premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9.
Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Trishna tells the story of one woman whose life is destroyed by a combination of love and circumstances. Set in contemporary Rajasthan, Trishna (Freida Pinto) meets a wealthy young British businessman Jay Singh (Riz Ahmed) who has come to India to work in his father's hotel business.
After an accident destroys her father's Jeep, Trishna goes to work for Jay, and they fall in love. But despite their feelings for each other, they cannot escape the conflicting pressures of a rural society which is changing rapidly through industrialisation, urbanisation and, above all, education. Trishna's tragedy is that she is torn between the traditions of her family life and the dreams and ambitions that her education has given her.
The film was produced by Revolution Films and Ballet Boyz Productions, with financial support from Film i VÃ¤st and the UK Film Council. Filming took place in Mumbai from 26 February 2011 and lasted six weeks.
Trishna opened to a mostly positive response. It has a 67% score on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote "Winterbottom is a director who never repeats himself, films all over the world, and in "Trishna," effortlessly embeds his story in modern India". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal thought that the film was "spectacular visually, though awfully somber dramatically". It was nominated for Best Film at the London Film Festival and Tokyo Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Film Festival.
The film has earned $240,381 worldwide according to Box Office Mojo as of August 2012.
Michael Winterbottom's Trishna, a modern retelling of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Ubervilles, stars Freida Pinto as the title character, a young Indian woman who meets Jay (Riz Ahmed), the son of a rich real-estate man. He convinces her to come work in a hotel owned by his father, and because her family is in desperate need of money -- and he's charming and handsome -- she accepts. While things go well at first, she becomes pregnant and is forced to leave the job. Although Trishna tries to make it on her own as a dancer, Jay eventually returns and attempts to sweep her off her feet again. Trishna played at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Perry Seibert, RoviSee All Trishna Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 113&nbsp;mins
