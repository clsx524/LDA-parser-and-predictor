A young New York artist upsets the balance in a Southern California household in this drama from Ry Russo-Young (You Won't Miss Me) and Lena Dunham (Tiny Furniture). A 23-year-old woman named Martine (Olivia Thirlby) has just arrived in Silver Lake when she moves into a wealthy family's pool house, and begins working to complete her art film. Meanwhile, laid-back father of two Peter (John Krasinski) agrees to his wife's request to help their young guest finish the project. The more time Martine spends with her surrogate family, however, the more apparent it becomes no one will walk away from this situation unchanged. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Nobody Walks Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 82&nbsp;mins
