Bringing Up Bobby is a 2009 Christian direct-to-video comedy film directed by Chris Staron. It was the third film by Glowing Nose, who previously made Pint Size and Between the Walls.
Fifteen-year-old Bobby Wyler is challenged to figure out who he is and what he believes, but he doesn't succeed. His parent's will is read, he falls in love and child services take away his best friend. Now he must choose the path for his life before his circumstances choose it for him.
Angela Walker of ChristianCinema.com gave the film 45 stars, saying, "Parents will enjoy this film because it contains good messages about families and finding your identity in Christ. Some teenagers will enjoy the comedic nature and probably see themselves in the search for identity."
A European con artist attempts to give her ten-year-old son a stable upbringing in Oklahoma, but finds her efforts leading to disaster when her shady past finally catches up with her. Thanks to her talent for grifting, Olive (Milla Jovovich) has never stayed in one place for very long. But after her son Bobby (Spencer List) is born, she attempts to settle down in Oklahoma. Unfortunately, when Bobby's erratic behavior catches the attention of their conservative neighbors, Olive's carefully constructed fa√ßade begins to crack. Later, after an accident involving Bobby and prominent local businessman Kent (Bill Pullman), the truth about Olive's past finally comes out, forcing her to make the most difficult decision of her entire life. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Bringing Up Bobby Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
