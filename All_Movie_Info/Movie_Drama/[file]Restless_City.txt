Restless City is a 2011 independent drama film directed by Andrew Dosunmu. It was written by Eugene M. Gussenhoven and stars Sy Alassane, Sky Nicole Grey, Tony Okungbowa and Babs Olusanmonkun. It premiered on January 23, 2011 at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.
The film tells the story of Djibril (Sy Assane), a young African immigrant trying to make a life for himself in the streets of Harlem in New York. A struggling musician who hopes to one day score a record deal, he survives meanwhile by selling CDs on the street and taking on gigs as a courier with the help of his moped. When he meets the beautiful and vulnerable Trini (Sky Grey), he jeopardizes everything to save her from her squalid life.
The lives of African immigrants making their way on the rough and tumble streets of New York City inspired this independent drama. Djibril (Sy Alassane) is a 21-year-old man who has recently left Senegal for a new life in Manhattan. While Djibril once pursued a career as a musician, in New York he's too busy scouring the city for a job and keeping himself afloat to devote much time to his art. As sidetracked as Djibril may be, he can't help but notice Trini (Sky Grey), a beautiful fellow immigrant who lives in his neighborhood, and the two find themselves falling in love. However, Trini makes her living as a streetwalker, and she is currently under the thumb of Bekay (Anthony Okungbowa), a mean-spirited pimp and loan shark; Djibril wants to take Trini away from Bekay so they can find happiness together, but this is a dangerous and difficult task. Restless City was the first feature film from writer and director Andrew Dosunmu; the film was an official selection at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Restless City Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
