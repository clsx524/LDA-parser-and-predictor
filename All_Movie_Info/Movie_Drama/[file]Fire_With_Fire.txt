A firefighter who witnessed a deadly convenience store robbery enters the Witness Protection program, but is forced out of hiding after being targeted for death by the racist crime boss who's determined to see him dead. Jeremy Coleman (Josh Duhamel) was just finishing a long day of work when he ducked into the store for a few beers. Little did he realize his life was about to be changed forever. In the blink of an eye, ruthless white supremacist Hagen (Vincent D'Onofrio) bursts into the store, and guns down the clerk in cold blood. Terrified, Jeremy makes a daring escape amidst a hail of gunfire. Later, Hagan is arrested and police detective Mike Cella (Bruce Willis) takes charge of the investigation. When Jeremy sits down to identify Hagen in the line-up, however, the sociopathic madman reveals that he knows everything about the "anonymous" witness behind the two-way mirror. As Hagan's trial approaches, Jeremy is forced to give up his job to be placed in the Witness Protection program. Meanwhile, he enters into a passionate romance with U.S. Marshal Talia Durham (Rosario Dawson). When Hagan's attorney succeeds in having his client released from prison just weeks before the trial, the killer's henchmen come gunning for Jeremy and Talia. The situation turns critical when Talia is mortally wounded, forcing Jeremy to flee for Long Beach, Ca. Once there, Jeremy realizes that his only hope for protecting Talia is to rally Hagan's enemies against him, and fight alongside them as they aim to take down the vengeful killer once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Fire With Fire Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
