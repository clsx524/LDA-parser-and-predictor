Cheyanne (Lyndsy Fonseca) is a gorgeous stripper whose new marriage is shaken by her disease. Lili follows an overachiever (Rosario Dawson) who turns to her sister for help telling their mother of her diagnosis. And, finally, Pearl, an oncologist (Jeanne Tripplehorn) suddenly finds herself in the patient's seat.
