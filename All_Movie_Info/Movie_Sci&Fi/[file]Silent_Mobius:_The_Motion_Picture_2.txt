This sequel to the Silent Mobius movie based on the TV anime series finds Katsumi devastated over the death of her mother. Chief Rally Cheyenne begs her to stay and become part of the team, but Katsumi can't be reasoned with, even as demons descend upon Tokyo en mass, threatening not just AMP but all of humanity. With Katsumi's abilities, they can assume control over the Earth, and as long as she's overcome with grief, she's an easy target. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 59&nbsp;mins
