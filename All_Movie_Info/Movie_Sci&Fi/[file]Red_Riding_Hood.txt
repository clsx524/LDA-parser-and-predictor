A young girl entrusted with the task of delivering a special package to her grandmother finds herself faced with a most unpleasant stalker in this retelling of the classic fairy tale starring Daniel Roebuck, Debi Mazar, Sam Stone, and Joey Fatone and served up with a curious contemporary twist. Red is an adolescent girl whose ailing grandmother lives in the deepest reaches of the magic forest. Asked by her mother to deliver a package to the elder family member, Red eagerly agrees without realizing that her assignment isn't as much about getting the package to grandma as it is about carrying on the legacy that has been passed down through generations. In order to achieve the status of the legendary maiden in red, this frightened young girl will have to overcome her ultimate fear by outwitting the malevolent wolf that will do everything in his power to get the tender young morsel on his dinner plate. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 82&nbsp;mins
