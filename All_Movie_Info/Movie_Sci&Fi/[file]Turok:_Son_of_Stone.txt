Twenty years after being exiled from the village in which he was born, a mighty warrior returns to his home to find that a ruthless tyrant has slaughtered his family and spread death and despair across the land. Everything Turok ever knew is now gone, and the man responsible for this untold destruction is a ruthless warlord named Chichak. Now, with vengeance in his blood and nothing left to lose, Turok will cross fearlessly over into the Lost Land - a treacherous place where savagery rules, and primeval beasts stalk their prey with vicious ferocity. But Turok's tireless quest for revenge won't be easy, because before he reaches Chichak he will be forced to contend with not only man-eating dinosaurs and brutal cave-dwellers, but also the darkness that dwells somewhere deep within his own troubled soul. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 73&nbsp;mins
