In this adventure-fantasy, an American rocket ship crashes upon a remote island in the Pacific and an Air Force pilot and a scientist are assigned to find it. They get to the island and suddenly discover that the island is populated by a myriad of extinct animals, including dinosaurs. Fortunately, there is an island girl around to help the handsome captain and his crew recover important pieces of their craft and get back home. Some of this film is comprised of clips from Rocketship X-M and The Terror of Tiny Town. ~ Sandra Brennan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 84&nbsp;mins
