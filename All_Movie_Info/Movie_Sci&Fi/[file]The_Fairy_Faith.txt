Fairies have appeared in many cultures, including that of the ancient Celts, and Shakespeare utilized them in his plays. Hollywood has its famous fairies, notably Tinkerbell of Peter Pan, the Fairy Godmother of Cinderella, and the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio. The Fairy Faith looks beyond Hollywood to the more complex fairies of other countries, surveying the origins of the enduring belief in the creatures. John Walker, director of the video, also investigates the manner in which fairies are depicted in art and literature, and talks with some individuals who say they can see into the world of fairies. ~ Alice Day, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 77&nbsp;mins
