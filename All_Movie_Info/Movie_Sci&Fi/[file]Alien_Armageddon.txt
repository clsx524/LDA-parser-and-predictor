Los Angeles cowboys battle invading extraterrestrials after all Earth's major cities get wiped off the map. In the past, U.F.O. sightings were rare. But when mankind grew cynical, the aliens caught us off guard. Now, as flying saucers descend from the skies to launch a surprise attack, it begins to look as if humanity is doomed. Fortunately for all of mankind, a hard-charging group of urban cowboys have found a way to fight back -- and they won't stop until the invaders have retreated back to the stars. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Alien Armageddon Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 95&nbsp;mins
