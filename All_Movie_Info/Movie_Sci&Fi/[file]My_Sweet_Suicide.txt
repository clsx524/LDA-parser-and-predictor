A young man looking to kill himself finds falling in love is just a bit less challenging than ending his life in this black comedy. Kevin (Matthew Aldrich) is a young man who's been battling depression and bad luck most of his life, until he decides one day that it's just not worth the effort and he should end it all. However, committing suicide turns out to be a lot more difficult than he imagined, and when he meets an eccentric young woman named Molly (Michelle Leigh Thompson), she offers to help him arrange the sort of spectacular death she feels he deserves. However, Molly turns out to be no more gifted at self-destruction than Kevin is, and try as they might, they have a hard time finishing poor Kevin off. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 78&nbsp;mins
