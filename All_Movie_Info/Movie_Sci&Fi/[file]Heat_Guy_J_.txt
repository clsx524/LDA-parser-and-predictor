Daisuke Aurora is no ordinary police officer; his job is to use ESP to predict and prevent crimes before they happen. In the floating city of Judo, there is plenty of crime to forecast and Daisuke looks every bit the part of a noble crime-fighter, but even a do-gooder like him may have personal reasons that lurk in his subconscious, coloring his life and the way he does his job. His partner is an android named Jay, and with all the trouble that comes with battling potential terrorists along with his own demons, he could sure use the help. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 650&nbsp;mins
