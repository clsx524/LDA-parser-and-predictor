Littlefoot the Dinosaur sets out on a spectacular journey and makes a very unexpected discovery in this, the tenth film in the Land Before Time series. Youthful brontosaurus Littlefoot (voice of Alec Medlock) has a vivid dream in which he imagines travelling to a far-away land where there are many of his kind, and when he tells the story to his grandparents (voices of Kenneth Mars and Mariam Flynn), they take it as a sign to set out and find this mysterious place. After days of travel, Littlefoot and his family do, indeed, discover a new world where longneck dinosaurs are plentiful, including one they never expected to see -- Bron (voice of Kiefer Sutherland), Littlefoot's father, who went missing before he was born. While Littlefoot is thrilled to be reunited with his father, now he must choose if he should stay with Bron, or the grandparents who have cared for him for years. The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration also features the voice talents of James Garner and Bernadette Peters; Olivia Newton-John sings the theme song. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All The Land Before Time: The Great Longneck Migration Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 85&nbsp;mins
