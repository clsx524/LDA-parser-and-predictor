Littlefoot, Cera, Spike, Petrie and Ducky are all back for another song-filled prehistoric adventure in this full length, animated movie featuring the voices of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Sandra Oh. The gang meets a couple of bumbling Beipiaosauruses named Loofah and Doofah, who have gotten lost on their way to Berry Valley, and the gang decide to help their new friends get back on track - and gain some important wisdom along the way. The adventure turns out to be a lesson for everyone, when Littlefoot and his pals learn that even though the Beipiaosauruses ways may be silly, they still work out in the end. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 76&nbsp;mins
