A fame-seeking geologist and his fearless female photographer get more than they bargained for when they travel to a remote area near Mt. Fiji in order to verify rumors that dinosaurs still dwell in the area. When word spreads that a foliage-rich area of land around Mt. Fiji is home to a large breed of lizards that seem to be leftovers from the prehistoric era, a geologist and his photographer set out in hopes of making the discovery that will make them famous. Upon arriving at the site, however, a curious change in weather patterns stir a plesiosaur that dwells deep in a nearby lake. Now, anyone who wades into those waters becomes lunch for the ancient beast. Meanwhile, in a nearby ice cave, a pterosaur hatches from an egg that has been preserved for millennia in it's frozen surroundings. When these two beasts clash, the curious explorers and anyone else unfortunate enough to be within range will quickly find out just what kind of nightmarish horrors Mother Nature is truly capable of. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
