This dark and extremely violent anime series was created and produced by many of the same staff members responsible for Serial Experiments Lain. It is a heavily stylized series that relies on unique conventions in order to illustrate its plot sequences, for instance, the first episode features roughly ten lines of dialogue. The central story revolves around the decaying underground city of Lukuss and the body prosthesis called Texhnolyze. Conflicting factions at war for control of the city as well as the conflict between the city-dwellers and the world above provide for the basis of most episodes. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 100&nbsp;mins
