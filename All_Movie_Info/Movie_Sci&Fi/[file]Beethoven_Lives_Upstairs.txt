Prague and Ontario stand in for 19th century Vienna in Beethoven Lives Upstairs. Young Chris (Illya Woloshin) lives with his none-too-prosperous mother (Fiona Reid) and uncle (Albert Schultz), who are forced to take in a boarder. Enter a fellow named Ludwig (Neil Munro), with a hearing problem, a mass of eccentricities, and a genius for music.
