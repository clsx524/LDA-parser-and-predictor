This chilling and eye-opening documentary examines four very different cases of paranormal activity in the U.S. and England. From a Kentucky roadhouse to ancient English universities, viewers are taken on location and introduced to the people who encountered these poltergeists firsthand. As psychics and scientists grapple with the mystery of poltergeists, the real answers may lie hidden in the minds of those who have met them. Unexplained: Poltergeist features dramatic re-enactments that bring these terrifying encounters to life, as well as chilling interviews with victims who detail exactly what happened. ~ Scott Albright, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 50&nbsp;mins
