Littlefoot the dinosaur and his pals learn an important lesson about truth and consequences in this, the eleventh film in the Land Before Time series. Littlefoot makes friends with a pack of "Tinysauruses" -- unusually small dinosaurs known as mussauruses -- when they make their way into the Great Valley. When Littlefoot tells a few lies, however, to make himself sound more important, his words not only attract some large and hungry dinosaurs but put his new playmates in great danger. Can Littlefoot do something about the mess he made before it's too late? The Land Before Time: The Invasion of the Tinysauruses includes the voice talents of Camryn Manheim and Michael Clarke Duncan and features several new songs. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All The Land Before Time: Invasion of the Tinysauruses Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 81&nbsp;mins
