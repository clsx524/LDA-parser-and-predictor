Robots who've been designed to pose as humans find themselves the targets of a murderous maniac in this four-part anime OVA. In the 22nd century, the planet Mars has been colonized by the Earth, with most of the manual labor being performed by androids. Among the android population are unusual creations called "thirds," which are almost impossible to distinguish from human females. A madman, Ross D'Anclaude, has developed a passionate hatred for the "thirds" and has set out to destroy as many as he can, so Martian law enforcement authorities put two of their best detectives on the case, Ross Sylibus and Naomi Armitage. But both bring their own personal baggage to the case -- Ross distrusts robots after his former partner was killed by an android, while Naomi is herself a "third." For the English-dubbed version of Armitage III available in the United States, the voice of Ross Sylibus was dubbed by Kiefer Sutherland, while Elizabeth Berkley performs the voice of Naomi Armitage. ~ Mark Deming, RoviSee All Armitage III  Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 90&nbsp;mins
