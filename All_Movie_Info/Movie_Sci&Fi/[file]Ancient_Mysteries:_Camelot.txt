This documentary examines the legends and facts surrounding the mystery of the mythic place called Camelot and its wise leader, King Arthur. Whether fact or fiction, Camelot is revered as a peaceful and benign place where ideals of chivalry and service prevailed. Narrated by actress Kathleen Turner, the film searches for answers regarding the identity of Arthur and the location of Camelot. Archeologists weigh in on those subjects and more, while they continue to search for the actual round table used by Arthur's knights. ~ Rose of Sharon Winter, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 50&nbsp;mins
