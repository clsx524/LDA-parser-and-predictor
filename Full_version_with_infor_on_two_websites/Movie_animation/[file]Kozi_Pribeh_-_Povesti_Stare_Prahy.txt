Trouble erupts when Goat witnesses Jemmy falling for the beautiful Katy, a street-smart lass from Prague. The animal grows so wildly jealous over their relationship that it causes him to detest Katy by default. Meanwhile, Matthias, an impoverished student from the Faust House, struggles with his own greed and eventually agrees to sign his soul over to the devil. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviSee All Kozi Pribeh - Povesti Stare Prahy Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
