Boog plans an annual guys trip to spend time with his male friends. However, Elliot has distanced himself from him since he had started a family. Boog is disappointed since everyone else wants to spend time with their families which makes Boog go on a trip of his own, which leads him to a Russian traveling circus.
While in the circus, Boog meets Doug, a lazy, scruffy grizzly bear who is tired of performing in the circus on the sidelines. He craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of wildlife. Doug convinces Boog to switch his life in the forest for Doug's place at the circus. Boog accepts the offer, but the whole thing turns out a scam since all Doug wants to do was escape.
Meanwhile, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa, a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle and dance. When the couple begin working together, they obtain much more as a harmonious duet than it might seem at first glance. When Boog's pals find out about Boog's disappearance, they, as well as the pets put aside their differences and hatch a rescue mission to save Boog.
Boog's friends arrive at the circus. They want Boog to return home, but he does not want to leave Ursa. Suddenly, Doug arrives and apologizes to Boog for tricking him. While Doug performs the circus acts for the audience, Elliot tells Boog that he can stay at the circus if he wants to. Boog does not want to leave Ursa or Elliot, so he convinces Ursa to go live in the forest with them.
Ursa enjoys life in the forest. The guys finally go on the guys trip and sing Willie Nelson's "On the Road Again." In a post-credits scene, Alistair and Doug are enjoying their tour around the world.
Open Season 3 was animated at Reel FX Creative Studios, which also did animation for Open Season 2.
Like Open Season 2, the movie was released theatrically in different countries:
The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD Video in the USA on January 25, 2011.
Open Season 3 received mostly unfavorable reviews by critics and consumers, stating that it was composed of "...cheap actors, horrible story writing, and poor directing". One reviewer said, "This tiresomely predictable tale exemplifies everything that's wrong about straight-to-DVD animated sequels to big-budget mainstream films: the plot is utterly predictable and rehashes a lot of beats from the original effort, the major voice actors have been replaced by poor substitutes and the quality of the animation has dropped dramatically (most of the visuals are on the level of a video game or one of those cheap CGI Saturday morning TV shows)".
The adventures of everyone's favorite Grizzly Bear continue in this sequel that finds Boog joining the circus after Elliot and the rest of his pals pass on their annual boys-only retreat. When Boog decides to take the trip alone, he happens across a traveling circus and convinces a performing bear to trade places. Boog's fun under the big-top comes to an abrupt end, however, when the circus packs up and prepares to head back to Russia. In order to ensure that their best friend isn't shipped overseas, Elliot, McSquizzy, Mr. Weenie, and the rest of Boog's pals prepare to stage the ultimate break out. Featuring the voices of Crispin Glover, Steve Schirripa, Dana Snyder, and Karley Scott Collins. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Open Season 3 Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 75&nbsp;mins
