This family-oriented animated special travels into the Old Testament to recreate the events that befell King David and King Saul. When Saul grows insanely jealous of David's popularity, he unleashes his vengeance against David to drive him from the royal throne. But God has other plans in mind, as foretold in a prophecy by Samuel - plans that foretell David leading an army of men against Saul and winning back his title as King of Israel. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 75&nbsp;mins
