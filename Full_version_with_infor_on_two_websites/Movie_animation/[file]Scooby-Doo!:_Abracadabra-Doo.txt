The Mystery Inc. team investigates the strange case of a magician's school that's been beset by supernatural forces in this frightfully fun feature-length adventure. Scooby and the gang are visiting Velma's sister Madelyn at the Whirlen Merlin Magic Academy when they learn that a money-grubbing ice cream magnate has been sniffing around the school in an attempt to get it shut down. When a visiting banshee lets out a bloodcurdling scream and an enormous gryphon appears in the sky over Whirlen Merlin, it's up to Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby to brave the unknown get to the bottom of this fantastical mystery. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 75&nbsp;mins
