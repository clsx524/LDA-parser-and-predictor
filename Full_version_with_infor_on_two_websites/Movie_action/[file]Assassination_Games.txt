Assassination Games is a 2011 American action film directed by Ernie Barbarash, and starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins.
Vincent Brazil (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a contract killer, willing to take any job if the price is right. Roland Flint (Scott Adkins) left the assassin game when a ruthless drug dealerâ€™s brutal attack left his wife in a coma. When a contract is put out on the same cold blooded drug dealer, both Brazil and Flint want him dead: one for the money, the other for revenge. With crooked Interpol agents and vicious members of the criminal underworld hot on their trail, these two assassins reluctantly join forces to quickly take out their target before they themselves are both terminated.
Assassination Games began development under the working title The Weapon with Russel Mulcahy attached to direct. Initially Steven Seagal had signed on to star alongside Van Damme with the film's plot synopsis notably different from the final version:
In The Weapon, Jack Conway (Steven Seagal) and Derek Chase (Jean-Claude Van Damme) are the two best assassins in the world but unknown to each other. While Conway is a master sharpshooter, Chase is equally skilled with a knife. These two rival assassins form an uneasy alliance to take down the head of a drug cartel.
After Steven Seagal was dropped out of the role, Vinnie Jones was considered to replace Seagal though the role eventually went to Scott Adkins.
The film was released on DVD on September 6, 2011.
On October 10, 2011, DVD was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment at the UK in Region 2.
