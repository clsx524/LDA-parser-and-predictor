The Greatest Battle (Italian title Il grande attacco "The great attack"), also known as Battle Force and The Biggest Battle is an Italian Macaroni war movie.
Despite the great cast the movie generally received poor reviews. For Mick Martin and Marsha Porter it shows "lots of phony battle scenes, bad acting, and a poor script". Leonard Maltin writes: "Amateurish muddle about WW2 combines tired vignettes with well-known stars, dubbed sequences with others, and newsreel footage narrated by Orson Welles. A waste of everybody's time".
In 1942 an elite fighting unit was formed, officially named the First Special Service Force. They were made up of mountain men, hunters and all-around misfits, and were trained to scale cliffs, jump out of airplanes, and kill Nazis. The following summer, days before the invasion of Sicily, the best of these men were handpicked for a desperate mission. Amidst the bloodshed of World War II, these men went armed for combat, and the only way out was to aim, fire and stay alive.Theatrical Feature Running Time: 102&nbsp;mins
