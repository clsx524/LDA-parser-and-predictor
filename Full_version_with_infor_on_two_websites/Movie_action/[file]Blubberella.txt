Blubberella is a 2011 action film written and directed by Uwe Boll, to be released on DVD and Blu-ray at the end of July. The entire film is a scene-for-scene spoof of BloodRayne: The Third Reich with most of the same cast and crew.
The plot revolves around an obese dhampir superhero, set in Nazi-occupied Europe.
In a time when evil is arising and all hope is fading, only a true hero can bring forth salvation. Her name is Blubberella. Half vampire, half human, and all trouble, Blubberella loves nothing more than killing Nazi soldiers, and a substantial turkey on rye. She has moved through the centuries battling the forces of evil, while perfecting the ultimate cotton candy recipe. But when she comes face to face with her arch nemesis and commandant of the German army, she accidently transforms him into a powerful day-walking vampire. Now, Blubberella must face a legion of undead Nazi soldiers in her valiant struggle against bloodshed and tyranny.See All Blubberella Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 86&nbsp;mins
