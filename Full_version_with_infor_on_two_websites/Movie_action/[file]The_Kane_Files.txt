A former hit man returns to his murderous ways in order to save his wife and their dying son after being double-crossed by a powerful underworld boss who dispatches a dirty cop to silence him forever. Scott Kane (Drew Fuller) turned his back on contract killing in order to raise a family. But when his son falls gravely ill and requires expensive medical treatment, Kane convinces his wife Anne (Whitney Able) that he needs to carry out one last hit for his old boss Daniel Morgan (William Atherton). Little does Kane realize that Morgan has no intentions of paying for his services, and once the job is done the desperate father ends up in prison. Meanwhile, Morgan recruits crooked cop Jace Olsen (Ethan Embry) to make sure Kane never sees the outside again. But Kane survives, and once free he races to his family's rescue as Olsen attempts to finish the job he failed at the first time, and FBI Agent Thompson (William Devane) begins closing in fast. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Kane Files Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
