Set in 19th century Japan directly before the revolution, PeaceMaker finds 15-year-old Ichimura desperate to avenge his parents' murders. He joins the Shinsengumi, an elite class of warriors who keep the peace in their community, but only as a page. However, Ichimuragrows stronger and more capable by the day, and while his taste for vengeance grows, so does the people's desire to begin the revolution, potentially culminating in an explosion that will surely involve bloodshed and destruction at the dawn of the Meiji period, a new era for Ichimura and for Japan. ~ Cammila Collar, RoviSee All PeaceMaker  Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 600&nbsp;mins
