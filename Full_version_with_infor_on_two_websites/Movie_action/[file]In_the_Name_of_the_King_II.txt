In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds is a 2011 fantasy adventure film and the sequel to In the Name of the King. The film was directed by Uwe Boll and stars Dolph Lundgren, Natassia Malthe and Lochlyn Munro.
Granger (Dolph Lundgren) - a former Special Forces soldier living in modern day Vancouver - is sent on a quest to fulfill an ancient prophecy. He is forcibly pulled into a time portal in his home after fighting off a small group of hooded assassins who try to kill him. He finds himself several hundred years in the past, in the forested war-torn Kingdom of Ehb. Granger teams up with an unlikely band of allies, accompanied by a female doctor named Manhattan (Natassia Malthe), with the goal of slaying the leader of the "Dark Ones"; a witch known only as the Holy Mother (Christina Jastrzembska). Fighting against all odds, Granger not only must kill the Holy Mother, but must free the land from the grasp of the evil tyrant Raven (Lochlyn Munro) and save the kingdom as well as find a way to get back to his own time.
Dolph Lundgren initially turned down Uwe Boll's offer before coming back on his decision when he and his wife decided to get a divorce.
Principal photography began December 1, 2010 for a planned 2011 release. Six people were injured in an explosion on the set on the last day of shooting.
