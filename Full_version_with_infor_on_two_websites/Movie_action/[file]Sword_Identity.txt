A swordsman must prove his abilities to a dizzying variety of opponents in this witty take on martial arts action cinema. A nameless warrior (Song Yang) wanders into the Chinese city of Shuangye and announces he intends to open a school to train students in the martial arts. However, the man with the sword soon learns that's not as simple as he hoped; there are four long-established schools in Shuangye, and he must defeat representatives from each academy before he's allowed to open for business. He also discovers his Japanese weapons draw suspicion from Qie (Ma Jun), who oversees all four schools and believes the new arrival is an outlaw up to no good. Eventually, the swordsman must take on a small army of fighters to prove his mettle while forging an unlikely alliance with a troupe of dancers led by Sailan (Xu Fujing). Wo Kou De Zong Ji (aka The Sword Identity) was the first feature film from writer and director Xu Haofeng, previously known as an author and film historian. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 110&nbsp;mins
