King and Clown director Lee Joon-lk takes the helm for this adaptation of the popular Korean manga Like the Moon Escaping from the Clouds, which follows the quest of a blind swordsman from the Chosun Dynasty to seek vengeance against a former ally-turned-greedy politician. The year is 1591: Japanese forces have invaded Korea, though internal struggles between the East and West Chambers are preventing King Seonjo from protecting his country and people. As advisors on both sides plot to kill the king, charismatic politician Lee Mong-Hak (Cha Seung-won) takes advantage of the power vacuum to found a new political party that can strike back against the invading Japanese army. When the East and West Chambers accuse Mong-hak of treason, the determined leader withdraws to the countryside, forms an army, and hatches a plan to topple the government. But in his noble bid to battle corruption, Mong-hak leaves many enemies in his wake. One such foe is Hwang (Hwang Jung-min), a blind swordsman who used to be close friends with the rising tyrant. Recognizing the dangers that face his country should Mong-hak assume power, Hwang sets out on a mission to ensure that never happens. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 108&nbsp;mins
