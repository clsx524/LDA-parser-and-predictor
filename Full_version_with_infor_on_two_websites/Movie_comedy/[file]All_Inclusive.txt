Lust is on the program of events when a family visits an upscale resort in this comedy from Chile. Gonzalo (Jesus Ochoa) is a successful businessman who thinks his family needs to spend some time together away from the stress of the city. Gonzalo books a vacation at a resort in the Yucatan, where melodramatic re-enactments of Mayan rituals are part of the daily entertainment. Gonzolo arrives at the resort with his blas√© wife Carmen (Valentina Vargas), rambunctious teenage daughter Camila (Martha Higareda), downcast and newly single twenty-something daughter Maca (Ana Serradilla) and hormonally overdriven teenage son Andres (Jesus Zavala). Nearly everyone in Gonzalo's family is looking for some sort of diversion while away from home, and each of them find it, though the results are not always quite what they expected. All Inclusive was an official entry at the 2008  Guadalajara Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
