However, when the paparazzi track them down, and with the locals smelling a payday, Lara becomes upset and runs away. In desperation her management team, led by Steve Korbitz (Michael Urie), decide to stage a fake wedding, hoping the paparazzi will fall for the scam and leave the island.

A jilted bride enters into an unusual arrangement with a Hollywood actress and gets a second chance at true love in this romance starring David Tennant and Kelly MacDonald. Abandoned at the altar on the biggest day of her life, Katie (MacDonald) retreats back to her home on a small Scottish island and prepares to live the rest of her life alone. Shortly thereafter, however, Hollywood icon Lara Tyler (Alice Eve) decides that the very same island would be the ideal setting for her upcoming marriage to her handsome fianc√©e James (Tennant). But try as Lara might to keep the location of her nuptials a secret, the paparazzi soon descend on the island cameras in hand, eager to get the scoop. In a clever bid to trick the opportunistic shutterbugs, Lara recruits Katie to pose as the bride and walk down the aisle. As the big day draws near, however, everyone involved discovers just how complicated true love can be. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Decoy Bride Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 89&nbsp;mins
