Demoted is a 2011 American comedy film directed by J. B. Rogers and starring Michael Vartan, Sean Astin, Celia Weston and David Cross.
Two best work buddies at a tire company, Mike (Sean Astin) and Rodney (Michael Vartan), love partying with their whimsical boss (Robert Klein) and making the day-to-day to co-workers Ken Castro (David Cross) and Jane (Celia Weston) a living hell. When the boss ends up dead after a night of too-hard partying, Ken is promoted above Mike and Rodney and demotes them, making Jane their boss. As they begin to try and function within the confines of this role-reversal, they learn some hard-fought lessons about the effects of their behavior. In the process, as they begin to balance their personal lives, Rodney with upper-crust fianc√©e (Sara Foster) and Mike with a new boss (Constance Zimmer), a chance to redeem themselves and help save the company arises.
Two chauvinistic tire salesmen plot revenge against a brown-nosing colleague who demotes them both to secretarial positions after becoming the new boss. Rodney (Michael Vartan) and Mike (Sean Astin) always put more work into harassing their geeky coworker (David Cross) than selling tires. But when their boss drops dead at a local strip club, the target of their torment becomes the new head executive - and his first order of business is to make Rodney and Mike administrative assistants. Meanwhile, after enduring endless humiliation and fetching countless cups of coffee, two pranksters begin plotting their revenge. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Demoted Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 94&nbsp;mins
