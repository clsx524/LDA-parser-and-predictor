Sexual Chronicles of a French Family French: Chroniques sexuelles d'une famille d'aujourd'hui is a 2012 French comedy-drama film produced and directed by Pascal Arnold and Jean-Marc Barr.
After youngest son Romain is caught filming himself masturbating in class, his mother Claire rounds up the family to talk about their sexual experiences.
The original French release of the film contains extremely explicit sex scenes and nudity. There is a version released in North America (and available on Netflix) that omits much of the explicit sex and nudity.
A sexually repressed family is forced to confront their hang-ups head on when the youngest son faces suspension for filming himself masturbating in school. As his mother realizes the importance of maintaining an open dialogue with her children and the topic of sexuality becomes less taboo in their household, three generations find themselves growing and maturing in ways they never before thought possible. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 79&nbsp;mins
