Attack of the Herbals is a 2010 Scottish horror comedy directed by David Keith from a screenplay written by David Ryan Keith, Liam Matheson and Alisdair Cook.
The film is about a group of locals who try to save Lobster Cove, their sleepy village, from disruption caused by a plan to build a new supermarket complex.
Set in a small Scottish village named Lobster Cove, the local community is enraged when a retailer is granted permission to build their supermarket complex on a nature spot. A crate is discovered washed up on shore and one of the group makes tea out of it.
Some of the local residents band together to create a herbal-tea cottage industry as a way to raise funds to fight the retailer. The tea proves incredibly popular and with its rejuvenating properties the elderly are finding a new lease of life. Unfortunately, there are side-effects...
Attack of the Herbals was filmed in and around Aberdeen, Scotland, on a single Canon 5D with follow focus. Much of the film focuses on the Aberdeen harbour area.
The music is by Leah Kardos, who collaborated with David Keith on previous works, two short films called "Demonic" and "Dead Funny".
Camelot Entertainment Group have gained distribution rights to Attack of the Herbals. Darknight Pictures, a division of Camelot Entertainment, confirmed they were to auction Attack of the Herbals at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.
