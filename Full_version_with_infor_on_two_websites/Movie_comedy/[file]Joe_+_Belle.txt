Director Veronica Kedar takes the reins for this high-strung black comedy / lesbian romance. Anxiety-ridden drug pusherJoe (Kedar) crosses paths with self-destructive French psychopath Belle (Sivan Levy); the two run headfirst into a gruesome accident and end up saddled with a body that they must discard. In the process, they must elude the Israeli police, and end up falling in love with one another in the dangerous locale known as Sderot - which just happens to be the site of multiple rocket attacks. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 80&nbsp;mins
