A nice-guy teen gives himself a bad-boy makeover, and quickly becomes the talk of the school before falling for a girl who doesn't give jerks the time of day. Labeled dull by his girlfriend and dumped for a guy who will treat her wrong, Adam decides that the time for being sensitive is over. Before long he's insulting every girl who comes his way - and they just keep coming back for more! But pretty Molly has dated her fair share of thugs, and now she's looking for a guy who will respect her. The old Adam would have been a perfect match, but Molly isn't falling for his new routine. Uncertain if his new approach is attracting the kind of girls he really wants, Adam realizes that he'll never find the right one until he drops the act, and focuses on just being himself. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All The Jerk Theory Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 94&nbsp;mins
