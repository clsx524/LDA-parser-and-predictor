An aspiring veterinarian strives to save her uncle's failing dog dancing studio by shaping her faithful canine companion into the Fred Astaire of fidos in this animal film for the entire family. Cassie's Uncle Peter has been shaping dogs into dancers for years. But when his studio is threatened with closure, Cassie (Jesse Draper) realizes that she may have the power to save it. With the Dog Dancing Championships fast approaching, the devoted niece begins teaching her dog Pijo how to cut a rug. Should he take the top prize, Uncle Peter will get to keep his studio. As the competition heats up, however, returning champions Gertrude (Bettina Devin) and Chaos prove to be fierce contenders. And though winning won't come easy, Cassie and Pijo prove they're up to the challenge by giving the judges a show they'll never forget. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Doggie B Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 87&nbsp;mins
