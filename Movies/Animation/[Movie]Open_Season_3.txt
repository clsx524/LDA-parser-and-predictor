Boog plans an annual guys trip to spend time with his male friends. However, Elliot has distanced himself from him since he had started a family. Boog is disappointed since everyone else wants to spend time with their families which makes Boog go on a trip of his own, which leads him to a Russian traveling circus.
While in the circus, Boog meets Doug, a lazy, scruffy grizzly bear who is tired of performing in the circus on the sidelines. He craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of wildlife. Doug convinces Boog to switch his life in the forest for Doug's place at the circus. Boog accepts the offer, but the whole thing turns out a scam since all Doug wants to do was escape.
Meanwhile, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa, a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle and dance. When the couple begin working together, they obtain much more as a harmonious duet than it might seem at first glance. When Boog's pals find out about Boog's disappearance, they, as well as the pets put aside their differences and hatch a rescue mission to save Boog.
Boog's friends arrive at the circus. They want Boog to return home, but he does not want to leave Ursa. Suddenly, Doug arrives and apologizes to Boog for tricking him. While Doug performs the circus acts for the audience, Elliot tells Boog that he can stay at the circus if he wants to. Boog does not want to leave Ursa or Elliot, so he convinces Ursa to go live in the forest with them.
Ursa enjoys life in the forest. The guys finally go on the guys trip and sing Willie Nelson's "On the Road Again." In a post-credits scene, Alistair and Doug are enjoying their tour around the world.
