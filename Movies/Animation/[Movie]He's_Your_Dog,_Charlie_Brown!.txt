Content: Charlie Brown, the round-headed worry wart created for the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schultz, has a dilemma on his hands. His usually well-behaved (and hyperintelligent) beagle Snoopy has been acting up as of late, and Charlie Brown's friends aren't too happy about it. Reluctantly, C.B. sends Snoopy to an obedience class at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. The dauntless dog graduates at the head of his class, and all is well, at least until the next Peanuts TV special. The 30-minute He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown was first telecast over the CBS network on February 14, 1968.
