Content: Upon reconnecting with his first love Amy on the eve of his marriage to tart-tongued Daisy, conflicted groom Joe hatches a plan to find out if Amy still loves him before the wedding bells start to chime. It's Christmas in Texas, and Joe (Daniel Bonjour) is living it up with his best-man Bubba (Jesse Johnson) on the night before his big wedding to Daisy. When Joe sees Amy for the first time in years, he can't believe his eyes. To Joe, Amy has always been the one that go away. Had they stayed together, he would have never gotten engaged to Daisy. When a communication gaffe leaves Amy with the impression that Bubba is marrying Daisy and Joe is the best man, the latter seizes the opportunity to find out once and for all if he still holds the key to the heart of the girl he never stopped loving. Richard Karn, Richard Riehle, and Mo Gaffney co-star.
