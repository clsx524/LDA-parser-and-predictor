Recruited by his boss to establish a new office in London, Los Angeles-based journalist Eric plans to send his dog Gabe to grandpa's house while he's away on business. Before Eric leaves, however, he must first uncover the identity of notoriously hermetic author RL Dutton, whose popular books have been topping the bestseller lists. Meanwhile, Gabe strives to form a love connection between his master and their neighbor Sarah in hopes that Eric won't want to leave town if he's got a new girlfriend. Little does the crafty pup realize that RL Dutton is in fact Sarah's pen name. Later, when Eric and Sarah's budding romance hits a serious roadblock, their future happiness rests in the paws of a little dog with a gift for bringing happy couples together.
