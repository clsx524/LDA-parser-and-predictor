Content: A drug-addicted medical-school dropout finds his life of privilege crumbling when he is sent to rehab following an attempted suicide, and he reluctantly agrees to join a seniors' group for men in order to avoid incarceration. Dan Topler (Tom Pelphrey) loves drugs. In fact, he enjoys them so much that he recently ceased studying to become a doctor so he could devote more time to getting high. But somewhere along the line it all went wrong, and Dan found himself atop the George Washington Bridge preparing to take the final plunge. Fortunately, he was talked down instead, and wound up in the care of Dr. Jacob Bernstein (Robert Vaughn). A veteran psychiatrist at a posh rehab clinic, Dr. Bernstein tells Dan he can avoid jail time if he agrees to participate in the seniors' group that he leads at his local temple. Initially resentful that he has to interact with grumpy geriatrics, Dan eventually warms to the men in the group while struggling with the impulse to relapse. Later, after falling hard for Dr. Bernstein's daughter Laura (Melissa Archer), the former addict decides to turn his life around and take something valuable away from the time he's spent in the company of older -- and wiser -- men.
