Cast: 
Content: A tomboy private investigator goes undercover as a sorority girl to protect a coed whose father is set to testify against a dangerous mobster in this comedy starring Miley Cyrus. Molly (Cyrus) is a teenage private eye who gets the evidence most sleuths can't. But when the FBI asks her to pose as a rich sorority girl, she's not sure she'll be able to convincingly shed her gruff exterior. With a little make-up and a new wardrobe, however, Molly fits right in on campus. Before long she's best friends with the girl who has information that could bring down the mob. Meanwhile, the obnoxious antics of Molly's hopelessly spoiled sorority "sisters" repeatedly test both her patience, and willingness to maintain her cover. Jeremy Piven and Kelly Osbourne co-star.
