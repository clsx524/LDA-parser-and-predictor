Content: A mismatched canine duo teams up to protect their masters from a scheming pair of thieves in this Christmas comedy for the whole family. As The Bannister family arrives at their beloved Aunt Barbara's house in Southern California, the children are delighted to be greeted by a mischievous puppy named Eve (voice of Peyton List). Unfortunately, the Bannister's loyal dog Zeus (voice of Joey Lawrence) is less than thrilled by the adorable new addition to the family. Zeus sees Eve as a troublemaker, and, deciding that the house isn't big enough for two canines, runs away. But when Zeus spies sneaky bandits Ted and Stewey sneaking into Aunt Barbara's house as the family heads to church, he realizes that his only hope for thwarting the burglary is to team up with Eve, and teach the crooks a lesson in respecting other people's property.
