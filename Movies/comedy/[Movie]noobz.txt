Content: Four friends face down a mace-spraying mother, an '80s arcade champ, and Casper Van Dien in their quest to take the top prize at the Cyberbowl Video Game Championship in L.A., and prove that all of those hours playing Xbox weren't spent in vain. When Cody lost his job, he turned to video games for comfort. Meanwhile, things go from bad to worse when Cody's gorgeous wife grows weary of being married to a gamer, and walks out on him. But when Cody's pal Andy (Jason Mewes) rallies their old gang the Reign Clan to compete in the Cyberbowl Video Game Championship, it looks like the perfect opportunity to put their gaming skills to use, and win a big cash prize in the process. With the old pals Oliver (Matt Shively) and "Hollywood" (Moises Arias) in tow, Cody and Andy set their sights on L.A. Unfortunately for the Reign Clan, the forces of the universe seem to be working against them. Now, as the contest draws near and Andy finally gets some quality face time with gamer goddess Rickie (Zelda Williams), the Reign Clan find that their enemies on the virtual battlefield are no match for the real-life foes who are determined to see them fail.
