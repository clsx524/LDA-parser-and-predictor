Years later, Lauren is recovering from a messy break-up, and Katie is living in her late grandmother's apartment when the rent control runs out. In order to avoid losing the apartment, Katie invites Lauren to move in and help out with the payments. Fate intervenes, however, when Katie becomes fed up with Lauren's boisterous bedroom antics, and learns that her new roommate has a naughty side that could earn them both some quick cash. With Lauren in charge of the business and Katie catering to the clients, the mismatched pair launch a phone-sex line that quickly proves a smashing success.

Wiki info: 
For a Good Time, Call... is a 2012 American comedy film directed by Jamie Travis. It stars Ari Graynor, Lauren Miller, Justin Long, Mimi Rogers, Nia Vardalos, Mark Webber, and James Wolk.

After Lauren is told by her boyfriend that he wants to take a break while he's in Europe for the summer, she is unable to afford a place of her own. Her old friend Jesse informs her of this beautiful apartment right by Gramercy Park, but doesn't include the fact that his other friend Katie lives there. This is because Lauren and Katie can't stand each other. Back during their freshman year of college, Lauren had to drive an inebriated Katie home from a frat party. During the short first meeting, Katie accidentally spilled her own urine onto Lauren when she peed inside an empty slushie container, and was promptly thrown out of the car. Despite their clear disdain for each other, they reluctantly move in together since they both have no better options.
One night, Lauren hears strange noises coming from Katie's room. Believing she is being attacked, she opens the door to see Katie is saying sexually explicit things on the phone. Katie explains that her career as a writer doesn't earn her enough money to live in New York, so she does some work as a phone sex operator. Lauren is clearly disgusted by her roommate's profession, but makes some suggestions to how she could make more money. Several weeks go by, and Lauren loses her job at a publishing company when her boss decides to retire. She joins forces with Katie to create a highly lucrative phone sex business and eventually joins her as a second operator. In the process of their venture, both girls start to become firm friends. However, a betrayal will threaten this new-found harmony.
