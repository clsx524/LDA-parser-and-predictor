Content: In Tyler Perry's Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection, Eugene Levy plays George Needleman, the CFO of a corporation that is about to be exposed as nothing more than a Ponzi scheme that stole millions from various charities. George knew nothing about the company's crimes; he's just the convenient fall guy. It turns out that the operation was also laundering money for the mob, so he agrees to help prosecutors build a case against the other executives and testify in court in exchange for going into hiding. George packs up his much younger second wife (Denise Richards), his bitter teenage daughter (Danielle Campbell), his neglected younger son (Devan Leos), and his dementia-addled mother (Doris Roberts), and together they travel to the safe house that Brian (Tyler Perry), the case's lead prosecutor, has chosen for them. However, that safe house is really the home of Brian's tell-it-like-it-is aunt Madea (also played by Perry), who helps the family get over their personal and legal issues.
