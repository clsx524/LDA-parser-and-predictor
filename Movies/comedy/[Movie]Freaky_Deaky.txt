Content: A Detroit cop's first day in the sex crimes unit reveals just how bizarre the lives of wealthy elite can get in this off-beat crime comedy set in the 1970s, and adapted from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Chris Mankowski (Billy Burke has just transferred into sex crimes from the bomb squad when a smoldering beauty (Sabina Gadeki) walks into his office accusing affluent local Woody Ricks (Crispin Glover) of rape. Hopelessly smitten by the pretty accuser, Mankowski launches a full investigation into the drunken eccentric Ricks, and promptly gets suspended for his efforts. But Mankowski rightly senses that there is more to the story than he realizes, and soon finds that the woman he's fallen for isn't the only shady character trying to get something from Ricks. Meanwhile, as the dogged detective investigates a host of potential suspects including Ricks' scheming servant and ex-Black Panther Donnell Lewis (Michael Jai White), volatile romance novelist Robin Abbot (Breanne Racano) and her mad-bomber accomplice Skip Gibbs (Christian Slater), and even Ricks' own yuppie brother (Andy Dick), each new clue yields an even stranger revelation than the last.
