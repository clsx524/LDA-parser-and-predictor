Content: Corbin Bernsen of L.A. Law and 25 Hill directs this family-oriented comedy starring George Newbern and Megyn Price. Martin Taylor (Newbern) is a dad who has fallen out of touch with his family: his daughter spends time with a group of friends unknown to him, his older son only communicates with the family via a sign on the bedroom door, and his younger son spends hours a day watching faith-themed programming on television. In a drastic move, Martin cuts off all power, water and heat and seals the family up in the home, allowing them no contact with the outside world, in an attempt to bring everyone closer together. In the process, the members of this clan begin to reassess their own priorities and develop a stronger sense of spiritual faith, individually and collectively.
