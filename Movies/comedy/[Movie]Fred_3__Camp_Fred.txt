Content: Fred Figglehorn's trip to summer camp turns into a total bust after his mother mistakenly signs him up to attend the dreaded Camp Iwannapeepee. School's out, and now it's time for some serious fun in the sun. But when Fred (Lucas Cruikshank) realizes that his mother has accidentally enrolled him in Camp Iwannapeepee, dark clouds seem to gather overhead. Is outwardly-amiable camp director Floyd (Tom Arnold) in fact a hideous rat monster who feasts on unsuspecting campers? And if so, what can Fred's muscle-bound father (John Cena) do to help him get back home alive? Meanwhile, as Camp Iwannapeepee prepares to face Kevin's Camp Superior in the annual Summer Camp Games, Fred makes the most of his miserable vacation with a little help from some new friends.
