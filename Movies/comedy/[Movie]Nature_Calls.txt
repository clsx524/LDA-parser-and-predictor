Content: An assistant scoutmaster takes a group of sheltered youths on an unauthorized outing, fleeing from his straight-laced brother, an overzealous security guard, park rangers, and angry parents while attempting to shape his young charges into respectable boy scouts. The son of a late, great scoutmaster, Randy Stevens (Patton Oswalt) plots to take his shrinking troupe on a trip that would have made his father proud. Crashing the slumber party that his upwardly mobile brother Kirk (Johnny Knoxville) is throwing for his newly adopted 10-year-old son, Randy lures the kids away from their television trance with promises of the ultimate scout trip. But when Kirk catches wind of Randy's plan, he recruits his loyal security guard (Rob Riggle) to bring the kids back to the safety of the suburbs. Meanwhile, as word of the outing spreads and a massive search gets underway, Randy realizes that turning these 21st century tykes into true scouts will be no simple task.
