Content: A Texas housewife turns murderess after discovering that her criminal husband was planning on keeping the take from a big robbery all to himself, but finds her options quickly shrinking as a concerned sheriff and a tenacious private detective show up determined to crack the case. When Lorna (Gina Gershon) married Dale (Val Kilmer), she knew he was a small-time crook. But when Dale commits armed robbery and attempts to keep his $100,000 payday a secret, Lorna goes off the deep end, and shoots him dead. Hatching a plan to run away with her best friend Tiny (Kelli Giddish), the hair-trigger housewife searches desperately for the money when the local sheriff (Ray Liotta) comes knocking on her door, and a nosy detective (Wayne Duvall) shows up searching for clues. Now, the only way out is to discretely dispose of the body, and somehow escape without getting caught.
