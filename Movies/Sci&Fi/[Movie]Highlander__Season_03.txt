Content: Back in Vancouver after narrowly escaping destruction by an old enemy, handsome 400-year-old Immortal Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) repurchase the martial-arts store owned by Charlie DeSalvo (Adrian Paul), who is off to fight a revolution in the Balkans, as Highlander begins its third season. Working side by side with Duncan is his close friend, and fellow immortal, Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch). It is during season four that Duncan again falls in love with a mortal, an ER surgeon named Ann Lindsey (Lisa Howard). Like the late lamented Tessa Noel before her, Ann eventually stumbles onto Duncan's secret Immortal identity but is determined to make their romance last -- and to that end, she follows along as Duncan takes his annual pilgrimage to Paris. Ultimately, however, the lovers come to a parting of the ways...but the legacy of their relationship will return in subsequent seasons. Among the new characters introduced this season are Amanda Darieux (Elizabeth Gracen), a sexy cat burglar; and Adam Pearson (Peter Wingfield), who like Duncan's friend Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes), is a member of The Watchers, a secret organization of mortals dedicated to hunting down and destroying evil Immortals. Adam in fact has a special assignment: He is to monitor Methos, the legendary "world's oldest man," assuming that Methos is indeed a genuine Immortal and not merely a myth. That both Amanda and Adam are not precisely what they seem to be will not be revealed until later in the series' run. Season four of Highlander ends on a note of high tension, with Amanda unwittingly unleashing a dangerous enemy of Duncan MacLeod, and the Watcher operation in peril of being exposed to the world -- which of course would have disastrous residual consequences for Immortals everywhere.
