Content: This unusual sci-fi thriller concerns Dr. Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath), a seemingly infertile young woman who will do virtually anything in her power to conceive a child. Through the miracle of modern science, she inherits a cloned son named David (Rocko Hale). For a time, all appears well, until David reaches his seventh birthday, and disasters suddenly begin to plague the earth -- disasters that seem to be emanating from the young boy himself. Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell) turns up and admits a long-buried secret: the DNA used to clone David came from the Shroud of Turin -- meaning that the tyke just may be Jesus Christ recreated.
