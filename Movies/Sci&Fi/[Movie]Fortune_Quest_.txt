Content: This four episode OVA revolves around a madcap fantasy plot. A group of archetypical fantasy characters (a mage, a bard, a thief, a healer, etc.) get involved in more of an adventure than usual when the simple task of fetching some holy water has massive ramifications. Can such a rag-tag troupe save the world from destruction?
