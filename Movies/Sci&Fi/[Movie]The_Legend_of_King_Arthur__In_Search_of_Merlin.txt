Content: While Merlin the Magician is usually regarded as one of the major characters within the fables of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the truth is that both of them existed in entirely separate folk mythologies before their paths began to merge many years down the line, with Merlin bestowing upon King Arthur the powers that made him great. The Legend of King Arthur: In Search of Merlin is a documentary which examines the origins of Merlin, how he came to be associated with King Arthur, and how the myth of the magician fueled the tales of the real-life King.
