Content: Merrill, Genie, and Melissa comprise an all-woman ruin-raiding trio. They have no trouble standing up to both sword and sorcery, but when they come across a tomb sealed with a magical spell, they realize that they could use a magician of their own. Enter Louie. He may be young, obnoxious, and inexperienced, but unlike most magicians, he likes to be immersed in the action rather than hiding in a book. Reluctantly, the ladies let him join them. He might be more trouble than his magic skills are worth, but he makes up for it with rowdiness and fun.
