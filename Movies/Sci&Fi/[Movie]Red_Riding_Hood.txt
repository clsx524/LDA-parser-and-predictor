Red is an adolescent girl whose ailing grandmother lives in the deepest reaches of the magic forest. Asked by her mother to deliver a package to the elder family member, Red eagerly agrees without realizing that her assignment isn't as much about getting the package to grandma as it is about carrying on the legacy that has been passed down through generations.
