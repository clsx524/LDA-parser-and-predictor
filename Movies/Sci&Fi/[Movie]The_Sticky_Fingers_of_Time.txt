Content: Writer-director Hilary Brougher, during a four-week Super-16mm shoot, made her directorial debut with this low-budget time-travel tale about '50s journalist-novelist Tucker Harding (Terumi Matthews), author of The Sticky Fingers of Death. Transported from 1950 Brooklyn to the present, Tucker meets Drew (Nicole Zaray), who's just ended her relationship with used bookstore clerk Dex (Leo Marks). In the store, Drew stumbles across a copy of Tucker's novel and is intrigued to find, inside the book, a newspaper clipping describing Tucker's death 40 years earlier. Hilary Brougher describes this as "a story of two women, both New York area writers...entangled in non-linear time travel. There's virtually no special effects, so it's all in the head. The challenge is to make the audience believe that you're moving back and forth in time. And film, of course, lends itself to time travel." Shown at the 1997 Venice and Toronto film festivals.
