Content: Season five of Highlander has quite a few shocks and surprises in store for handsome, 400-year-old Immortal Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul). For several seasons, Duncan has known Adam Pierson (Peter Wingfield), a member of The Watchers, which is an ancient order of mortals foresworn to hunt down and destroy all evil Immortals. All this time, Adam has claimed it was his job to confirm the existence of Methos, the world's oldest man, and a member of the "Four Horseman," one of the most feared of all Evil Immortal conclaves. Now it is revealed that Adam is in fact Methos himself -- but before any damage can be done, he proves to Duncan that he is "reformed" and thus the two become close friends. But all is not well in the Immortal world. A villainous entity named Ahriman manages to trick MacLeod into a grisly act -- that of beheading fellow Immortal Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch), thereby killing him off permanently. Consumed with grief and rage over the death of his best friend, Duncan swears vengeance against Ahriman -- but he, and the audience, will have to wait until season six to see how this turns out.
