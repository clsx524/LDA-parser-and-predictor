Content: Steam Detectives combines the technology of old with the attitudes of new. While the only sources of energy in this series are steam and coal, the feel is decidedly modern and even punk. Amid the clouds of mist in this world, massive steam-powered robots called Megamatons have become a staple of the crime world and their huge, stomping presence has become ominous. Now a young detective called Narutaki stands up for peace in the city, along with the help of his friends Nurse Linlin and Goriki the "megaknight".
