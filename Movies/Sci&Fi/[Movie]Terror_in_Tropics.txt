Content: Three of the biggest names in horror history come together through the magic of modern filmmaking in director A. Susan Svehla's tribute to the Monogram, PRC and Chesterfield classics of yesteryear. By seamlessly blending newly shot footage with vintage films starring such horror icons as Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Lon Chaney, Svehla weaves the terrifying tale of an innocent girl who must travel to the dreaded Fog Island to claim an inheritance bestowed upon her by a mysterious stranger. Upon boarding the S.S. Enterprise, the pure of heart Mary Ankers discovers that she is not the only beneficiary listed in the strange will, and as she and a host of other inheritors eagerly sail towards their eerie destination, a sassy reporter, a brave photographer, and a no-nonsense detective climb aboard to cover the reading of the will and ensure that Mary doesn't fall prey to sinister whims of nefarious doctors Armand and Vitus Tesla.
