Content: S-CRY-Ed is set in the near future when select people begin to develop a specific ability to alter matter around them, turning anything into another specific object or thing. These people are called "alters" and, as in other stories based on this idea, such as X-Men and Witch Hunter Robin, those with these superior powers sometimes abuse them and are therefore feared by others. While many alters live outside the city, maintaining as much anonymity as possible, others choose to work for a secret government organization called HOLY, using their own powers to capture other alters. Those in HOLY's custody have the choice of remaining imprisoned or working for the organization. When young Kazuma runs up against HOLY's forces, many questions arise. If Kazuma is no threat to anyone, why must he choose? Does HOLY operate out of protection, or out of fear?
