Content: It may surprise some viewers to learn that although zombies represent a veritable fixture of the horror and science fiction genres, they also embody an integral component of Haitian culture. The speculative History Channel documentary investigates this multifaceted topic on both spiritual, cultural and scientific levels. Spirtually and culturally, it plunges into the dark and mysterious world of voodoo (or voudou), and features voodoo priest Max Beauvoir, who talks openly of his interaction with zombies. On a scientific level, the program features discussions with a biochemical researcher, who suggests that a scientific basis for zombies may indeed exist, recalling the ethno-botanical work done by Wade Davis and others. An anthropologist also turns up to discuss the relevance of zombies in voodoo culture.
