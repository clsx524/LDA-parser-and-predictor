Content: The indigenous Hawaiian music act Halau o Kekuhi(comprised of Pualani Kanaka'ole Kanahele, Nalani Kanaka'ole, and Kuma Hula) headline the performance video Holo Mai Pele, an episode of the popular PBS cultural arts series Dance in America. The groups dance and act out the titular work of Hawaiian musical theater, a mythical tale of the competition that surfaces between Pelehonuamea, goddess of the volcano, and Hi'iaka, her youngest sister. This rare glimpse into Hawaiian culture explores the themes of divine creation, love, jealousy, resentment, and romantic betrayal, which it interweaves into a stunning spectacle of music, movement, and color. As an added bonus, this fifty-six minute program also includes an exclusive interview with Kumu Hula and Pualani Kanaka'ole Kanahele.
