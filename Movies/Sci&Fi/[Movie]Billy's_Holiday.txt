Content: Since the breakup of his marriage, Billy Apples (Max Cullen), the stocky, middle-aged owner of a hardware store in Sydney, Australia, hasn't had much going on in his life. Billy has one hobby, singing with a jazz band in a club in his neighborhood; he knows that he's not much of a vocalist and that his teenage daughter Casey (Rachael Coopes) considers him an embarrassment, especially since she's convinced that he's to blame for her parents' divorce. But late one night, Billy sees several comets dotting the night sky, and something miraculous occurs -- suddenly, Billy is capable of singing like Billie Holiday! While many people are puzzled by this development (Billy himself is near the top of the list), his new sound packs them in at the club, and soon Billy's career as a singer takes off and he signs a recording contract. His ex-wife even suggests that she might give their marriage another try, but success goes to Billy's head and he becomes difficult to get along with; then Billy's voice starts to change back, prior to his appearance in a major music contest. This musical fantasy won the Australian Film Institute award for Best Adapted Score in 1995.
