Content: Featuring Saturday Night Live alumni and Austin Powers star Mike Myers in his first dramatic role, Pete's Meteor centers on ex-Junkie Pete (Myers), who is in the process of turning his life around when his two closest friends both die unexpectedly. Hoping to raise money for their children, he moves in with his late friends' kids and grandmother (Brenda Fricker). Before long, they witness what seems to be a miracle: A meteor lands in their backyard and the orphaned children believe it was sent from their parents to keep a wealthy scientist (Alfred Molina) from getting credit for it.
