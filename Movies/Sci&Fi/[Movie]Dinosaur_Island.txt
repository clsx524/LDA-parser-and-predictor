Wiki info: 
Dinosaur Island is a 2002 animated film from DiC Entertainment directed by Will Meugniot. Considered a family oriented picture, it is a unique adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel The Lost World by well-known animated movie veteran John Loy. The movie stands apart as the only attempt to adapt The Lost World in an animated format, combined with the popular reality-series format.
Four teenagers representing the four main "races" are chosen to participate in a Survivor-style television show. They are:
On the way to their filming location, their plane is brought down by an electrical storm. As the plane falls, they parachute out onto what appears to be an island, landing on an isolated mesa. The island, however, is inhabited by a variety of dinosaurs, including Iguanodon, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Pterosaur, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus.
The island is also inhabited by a form of unfriendly prehistoric human, Homo habilis. Putting aside their differences, the foursome endeavour to escape from both dinosaurs and a tribe of Homo habilis.
Like many of John Loy's works in the Land Before Time series, Dinosaur Island was a direct to home video movie. As the movie was produced as a take-off on the Survivor TV format, the small screen was considered the best overall method of release. Due to its success in Italy, L'isola del Dinosauri was additionally released in a special 3-Pack that included Pam Carter's Time Kid and Scott Heming's The Archies in Jugman.
