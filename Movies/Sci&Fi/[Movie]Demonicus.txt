Content: The demonic spirit of a crazed madman isn't about to let a little thing like being dead for 20 centuries get in the way of world conquest in this tale of terror. Gina (Venesa Talor) is a college professor leading a group of students on a hike through the mountains. The group happens upon a cave, where they discover a cache of ancient weapons and armor dating back to the days of the gladiators. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon), one of the students, decides to try a helmet on for size, but he's in for an unpleasant surprise -- the headgear is possessed by the ghost of Tyrannus, an evil and unscrupulous warrior of centuries past, and as James finds Tyrannus taking over his body, he attempts to murder his friends in a bid to bring the gladiator back to life. Demonicus also stars Jennifer Capo and Brannon Gould.
