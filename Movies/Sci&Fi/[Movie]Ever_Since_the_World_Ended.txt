Content: This pseudo documentary imagines the possible outcome after a strange and virulent virus sweeps the world, killing the vast majority of the Earth's population and reducing the city of San Francisco to only 186 people. Ten years after the virus first began claiming lives, Cal (Calum Grant) wanders Northern California with a video camera in an effort to document what is left of American civilization. A large commune, led by Mama Eva (Angie Thieriot), is the closest thing to a governing body San Francisco has left, but not everyone is welcome to stay with Eva and her group, and a number of misfits and lawbreakers wander the countryside, scavenging to survive. Mad Mark (Mark Routhier) was once a member of the commune, but his pyromaniacal tendencies led to his expulsion, and now he's wandered into the city, where he can start fires at will. A pair of surfing looters (Stewart Fallon and Simon Thieriot) crack wise about their fate as they break into long-abandoned homes, looking for valuables and often encountering the dead. A nomad named Santosh (Brad Olsen) wanders into Marin County, which has been reduced to a wasteland; there he meets Dan (Dan Plumlee), a former businessman who now gets by trapping wild game when he can find it. And a doctor (Mary Rutherford) sits down to discuss the plague and how it came to destroy the world as she knew it, nearly a decade after her battle to save the world was lost. Shot on videotape using the European PAL system for higher visual fidelity, Ever Since the World Ended was enthusiastically received in its screening at the 2001 Los Angeles Film Festival.
