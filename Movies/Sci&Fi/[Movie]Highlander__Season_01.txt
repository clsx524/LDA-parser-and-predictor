Content: To the citizens of Vancouver, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) is just your average handsome, ponytailed, introspective antiques dealer. In truth, however, Duncan is an Immortal, born 400 years ago in Scotland, totally impervious to death or serious injury unless he is beheaded in a sword fight with another Immortal. He has also, over the centuries, built up enormous strength and energy, the result of absorbing those qualities from evil immortals whom he has decapitated. Duncan's mortal lover Tessa Noel (Alexandra Vandernoot) is aware of his secret identity, and though saddened by the fact that she will grow old while he remains forever young, she loves him all the same. Among Duncan's friends and acquaintances are Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch), a reformed burglar who works in Duncan's antique shop, and TV reporter Randi McFarland (Amanda Wyss), who after witnessing a number of strange events is certain that there's something "different" about Duncan but can't put her finger on it. Halfway through the first season of Highlander, Duncan, Tessa, and Richie move to Paris establishing a pattern that would be followed in most seasons to come. Apprised by his mentor Darius (Werner Stocker) that evil forces are conspiring against him, Duncan is successful in warding those forces off -- but alas, Darius is not so lucky, and thereby hangs the plot strand that will be picked up when season two of Highlander gets under way.
