Content: Each culture has its own mythological traditions, and while everybody is familiar with the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, it should also be noted that the Irish have a deep and ongoing tradition of mythological legends of their own. Celtic legends are kept alive to this day on the strength of the storytelling tradition, and these tales are passed along from generation to generation. The aim of this program is the search for the Celtic gods of Britain. It's highlighted by a study of the mystery surrounding Finn Mac Cummaill, the mighty warrior of Fianna, and other Celtic warriors. This video provides a door into these enduring mystical traditions.
