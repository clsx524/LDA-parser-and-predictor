Content: Mireille Bouquet is a professional assassin who can handle absolutely any situation. Or can she? When Mireille receives a cryptic message containing a reference to her childhood memory of her parents' death, a deadly plot begins to unfold involving Mireille and a mysterious woman named Yuumura Kirika, who has the skills of a master killer but no memory of her past. Mireille agrees to take on Yuumura as a partner for the time being, but has no idea when she'll have to turn her back on Yuumura or even The Soldats, the organization that they work for. Highly stylized and almost completely bloodless, Noir includes many slick fighting sequences but little to no flashy imagery or gore. Noir is highly acclaimed for its soundtrack, which features electronica, opera, and French music.
