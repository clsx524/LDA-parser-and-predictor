Content: In the sixth and final season of Highlander, handsome 400-year-old Immortal Duncan MacLeod has returned to Paris determined to avenge the beheading of his close friend and fellow Immortal, Richie -- an act accidentally performed by Duncan but caused by evil demon Ahriman. Having given up his sword since Richie's demise, Duncan uses other methods to vanquish Ahriman -- and in so doing, he proves to himself that an Immortal can exist in modern times without having to fall back upon bloodshed. Somewhat relieved that he no longer has to kill to survive, Duncan feels free to pursue his romance with another Immortal, the beautiful Amanda Darieux (Elizabeth Gracen, now listed as one of the series' stars, as is Peter Wingfield in the previously recurring role of Methos, the World's Oldest Man). Alas, the couple's happiness is short-lived; along with Duncan's mortal friend Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes), Amanda is kidnapped and transported to another dimension by a vengeful Immortal who has vowed to destroy Duncan once and for all. Curiously, this situation leads to a series finale straight out of It's a Wonderful Life -- and in context, it all makes sense!
