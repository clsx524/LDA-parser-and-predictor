Content: The story of this fun magical fantasy film starts with the creation of the universe and the birth of the gods. Millions of years later, a crystal spaceship visits Earth as twin princes are born in the nation of Yamato. At Hijiri Palace, the emperor orders the younger prince executed, but a great white bird sent by the gods intervenes and drops him at a woman's house. Young Osu grows to manhood, and tries to gain back his father's trust, but must overcome an evil sorcerer, his jealous brother, and a series of deadly travails. Osu defeats his brother, and the wary emperor sends him to put down a peasant revolt, sure that it will mean the prince's death. Osu triumphs, however, and returns home as a valiant warrior, but still can't earn his father's forgiveness. The emperor's trusted sorcerer is scheming with a demon, Tsukoyomi, who wants to destroy the Earth. The demon can transform itself into an eight-headed monster dragon, Orochi, and was once destroyed with the Sword of Dark Clouds and imprisoned in a crystal spaceship. Now, TsukoyomiOrochi is coming back, and only Osu can save the world from his wrath. First, however, he has to battle a gruesome sea serpent and destroy the evil sorcerer. Only then can he claim his destiny and battle the great dragon on the back of the divine white bird, finally facing the beast as a giant lightsaber-wielding robot for the climactic showdown. Masahiro Takashima stars with Yasuko Sawaguchi and Sekiji Maro.
