Content: Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime as Littlefoot, Cera, Spike, and the rest of the gang return in this tale of friendship and exploration for the whole family! A fantastic downpour creates a mysterious "new water," and when Littlefoot sets out to explore the Great Valley, he soon strikes up a fast friendship with fun-loving water dweller Mo. When Mo confides to Littlefoot that he fears he will never find his way back to the Big Water, Littlefoot wastes no time in gathering his old pals in hopes of helping his new friend find a way back home. In addition to offering valuable lessons in friendship and courage, The Land Before Time: Journey to Big Water also features the Donny Osmond song "No One Has to Be Alone."
