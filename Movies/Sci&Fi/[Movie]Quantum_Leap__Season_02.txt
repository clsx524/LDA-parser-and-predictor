Content: Season two of Quantum Leap finds unwilling time traveler Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) trapped in someone else's body back in 1960 -- while in the present, Sam's holographic observer-advisor, Al (Dean Stockwell), is fervently begging a Senate committee to keep the Quantum Leap program alive. Later episodes feature Sam in "female" form: a fashionably dressed career woman in "What Price Gloria?: October 16, 1961" and a suburban housewife in "Another Mother: September 30, 1981." Other personalities assumed by Sam include a blind pianist in "Blind Faith: February 6, 1964" and a mentally challenged adult in "Jimmy: October 14, 1964." In the season finale, "M.I.A.: April 1, 1969," Sam is placed in the awkward position of trying to prevent Al's ex-wife from falling in love with someone else, while the "real" Al is lost somewhere as a POW in Vietnam.
