Content: Perhaps no greater desire rests nestled in the ageing and mortal minds of mankind than the quest to find the mythical fountain of youth. Its existence popularized in the European Age of Discovery and its long-rumored rejuvenating waters frequently said to have been the ultimate goal of Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon, stories of fountain of youth can be found that reach back as far as the third century. In this release, filmmakers and documentarians combine their knowledge of history to find out whether it was the prospect of vast riches which led de Leon to the sandy shores of Florida, or something far more intangible.
