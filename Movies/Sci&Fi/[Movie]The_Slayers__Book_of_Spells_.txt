Content: This OVA series finds spunky and powerful sorceress Lina Inverse and her serpent partner, Nahga, fighting the forces of evil in three self-contained half-hour episodes. From a mad scientist  making clones to help him capture Lina, to a psychotic mother hiring the twosome to train her son to be a knight, things always seem to get complicated for the bandits just before the big payoff. The job gets really hairy when a magician steals the dangerous Shadow Reflector, which can create a duplicate person with an exact opposite personality. Unlike the Slayers movies, this OVA is short on world-saving and long on silliness. Audiences may find belly-laughs added in place of lessons learned.
