Content: When the childhood friend of a paranoid agoraphobic attempts to coax her old friend out of his basement, she finds that there may actually be an element of truth to his insane ramblings in filmmaker David Fickas' delirious comedy-thriller debut. For nine long years Lloyd Profit (Fickas) has spent his days and nights locked in his dark basement, terrified of a unearthly force that he claims has overtaken the outside world. Suspecting everyone from his therapist to his mother of conspiring against him, Lloyd 's paranoia reaches a fever pitch when his old friend Traci (Pam Cook) attempt to snap him out of his downward mental spiral. Though at first Traci tries to convince herself that Lloyd's strange theories could never be true, the discovery of a sinister secret upstairs is about to challenge her entire perception of reality.
