Content: Tokyo has been ravaged by war and now all that remains are ruins of what was once a bustling metropolis. It is here that we find Haruka, a lone survivor with no family, living amid the rubble. She is far from alone, however. She is surrounded by five robot companions who both keep her company and keep her safe. There's Torgia, a combat robot with anger management issues; Reeves, who does housework with the attitude of a drill sergeant; Cleric, wise and advisory; Angela, protector and defender; and Spike, the youngest robot and Haruka's best friend. Together, the six of them search the devastated city for survivors.
