Content: This computer animated feature takes place on a distant planet where the inhabitants have been genetically altered by another race. The visiting species taught the natives to believe from their first moments alive that they are slaves to the "gods" that will return one day to inhabit the city that the natives must labor to build. One of these native creatures however, does not believe the dogma he has been taught and fights to break from his enslavement.
