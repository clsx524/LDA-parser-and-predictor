Content: Barbara Crampton, Gary Daniels, and Bryan Genesse star in this post-apocalyptic sci-fi adventure about a pair of twin brothers who have followed wildly different paths in life. Roland is a bounty hunter who kills without flinching, while Oliver has special antibodies in his blood that have allowed him to survive the plague that has wiped out most of the world's population. Oliver travels with his girlfriend, Christine, who is pregnant with his child. When Oliver is murdered, Roland is forced to become Christine's protector as she tries to escape with the unborn child, who may share Oliver's genetic immunity to the plague and therefore hold the key to humanity's future.
