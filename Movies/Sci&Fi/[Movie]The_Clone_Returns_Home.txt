Content: In this thoughtful science fiction drama from filmmaker Kanji Nakajima, Kohei Takahara (Mitsuhiro Oikawa) is an astronaut who is invited to take part in a top-secret scientific study in which a clone will be created from his DNA and brought to life in the event of his untimely death. Kohei agrees to participate, and when he loses his life as his mission goes awry while returning to Earth, the clone is brought to life. While the "new" Kohei seems healthy and all but indistinguishable from the original, a major flaw is soon discovered -- the clone has no memories past Kohei's childhood, and doesn't comprehend the notion of the astronaut's death. When the clone escapes, it happens to find Kohei's body near the crash site, and is jarred back to a memory of the death of Kohei's twin brother when he was little. The clone is convinced Kohei's corpse is actually the lost twin that died years ago, and he sets out to take the body back to his family. Kuron Wa Kokyo O Mezasu (aka The Clone Returns Home) received its American premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.
