Content: Season four of Highlander begins as handsome 400-year-old Immortal Duncan MacLeod returns to his native Scotland, which then leads to a tense reunion with Charlie DeSalvo (Philip Akin), the man from whom Duncan bought his Vancouver-based martial-arts store. Charlie is determined to kill a man who once saved the life of Joe Dawson, a member of the Watchers organization which hunts down and kills evil Immortals -- so naturally, Charlie and Duncan find themselves on opposite sides of the fence. This is but one of the many fascinating events distinguishing the series' fourth season. Sporadically coming back into Duncan's life is his former mortal sweetheart, Dr. Ann Lindsey (Lisa Howard), who in one of the year's later episodes gives birth to Duncan's daughter Mary. And in another romantic entanglement, Duncan has an affair with Amanda Darieux (Elizabeth Gracen), a onetime cat burglar who in the course of events has become an Immortal herself. The season ends with another burst of melodramatic excitements, as Joe Dawson is put on trial for his life by his fellow Watchers, accused of the unforgivable crime of revealing the existence of the Watchers to an Immortal -- namely, Duncan.
