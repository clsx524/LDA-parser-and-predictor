Content: Join host Josh Bernstein as he sails the Red Sea, plunges down a Zimbabwean gold mine, and ventures deep into the Ethiopian Bush on an epic, 4000-mile journey to discover the lost treasure of King Solomon. The wisest and richest of all the rulers mentioned in the Bible, King Solomon had access to vast quantities of pure gold. Though the Bible claims that the source of King Solomon's wealth was the goldmines of Ophir, nothing in the scriptures states where Ophir maybe located in the modern world. With nothing to guide him but his instincts, Bernstein sets out on a global adventure that could bring untold riches should he prove successful at unlocking a mystery that spans the centuries.
