Content: Gokudo is a professional adventurer with interests in money, women, and stealing both. When one of his usual exploits puts him in possession of a special rock, however, his world gets even wilder than usual. A genie named Djinn emerges from it who is willing to grant him three wishes, but Gokudo is rash and doesn't think wisely about his choices. He does end up with a magic sword, but he also ends up getting turned into a woman, hit over the head, and altogether disrespected as his adventure continues.
