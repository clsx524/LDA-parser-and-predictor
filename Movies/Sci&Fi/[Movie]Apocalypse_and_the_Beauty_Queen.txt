Content: Thomas Smugala helms the direct-to-video drama Apocalypse and the Beauty Queen. The film concerns 26-year-old cover girl Amber, who absconds from Manhattan when her age yields a devastating rejection from modeling. After she flees to a small town, the titular apocalypse occurs and destroys the country. Amber relies on her cunning and ingenuity to band the locals together, and helps them collect supplies and ammunition and stockpile food, but suddenly the power goes to her head and threatens to spin severely out of control. Meanwhile, a friend slyly and viciously manipulates the people of the community through Amber; then a guard falls in love with one of the underlings and brings Amber's authority and control to an end. The film co-stars horror icon Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre).
