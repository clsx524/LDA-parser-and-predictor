Content: The Cosmic Man is a moralistic sci-fi tale that does not quite live up to the pretensions of its title. Everything starts when a strange sphere settles down in a California canyon, causing both the scientific and military communities to gather around in an instant. The object appears to have one figure inside but no clear way of penetrating the sphere. As the military brass argue for a destructive course of action, scientist Karl Sorensen (Bruce Bennett) defends the sphere and its passenger, advocating a reasoned approach to the enigma. In the meantime, a ghostly entity wanders around town and a man nearly hidden underneath heavy clothing checks into the lodge where the antagonistic investigators are staying.
