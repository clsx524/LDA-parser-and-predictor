As word of the unusual occurrence travels through the village, some of the older dinosaurs wonder aloud if the youngsters have witnessed the fabled "Stone of Cold Fire," which is said to have miraculous properties. When Petrie's long-lost uncle Pterano arrives, he makes it his business to find the stone in a bid to take control of the tribe; meanwhile, Littlefoot and the other young dinosaurs set out to find the stone by themselves to unravel the mystery once and for all. Combining computerized images with traditional paint-and-ink animation, The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire features the voice talents of Kenneth Mars, Michael York, and Miriam Flynn.
