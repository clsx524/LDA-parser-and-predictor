Content: This fantasy follows one man over centuries as he is reincarnated from a medieval prince to a modern-day rock star. James Scott's life is a roller coaster of fate that finds him embarking on a career in music following a visit by the ghost of his old friend. Little does James know, his journey began hundreds of years ago in a past life, and unless he can overcome his struggles, he'll repeat them for eternity. Along the way he gets a little help from none other than John Lennon. Starring Caesar (who also performs his own music), Forgotten Savior was written, produced, and directed by Salvatore Scordato.
