Cast: 
Content: Direct-to-video auteur Lloyd A. Simandl directs Kari Wuhrer in this silly sci-fi exercise. Wuhrer portrays Sasha Burns, who must use all of her powers to help Governer Crombie (Daniel Fleischer-Brown) stop a spaceship from crashing into (and therefore destroying) Los Angeles. In an attempt to keep the audience from noticing the thin plot, the director has included many women-in-prison film cliches and given them a futuristic twist.
