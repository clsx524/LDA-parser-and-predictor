Content: Lina and Gourry don't ask for much. After the events of the original Slayers TV show, they're looking for a little time off and a lot of good food. They think they've found both when they find themselves relaxing on the beach, enjoying the seafood they were given as payment by a small fishing village. Unfortunately, the food turns out to be cursed! Anyone who eats it is suddenly unable to speak anything but a bizarre octopus language. The next thing they know, the whole team has reassembled, and now Lina, Gourry, Zel, and Amelia are back to business, braving the watery depths in pursuit of another heroic mission.
