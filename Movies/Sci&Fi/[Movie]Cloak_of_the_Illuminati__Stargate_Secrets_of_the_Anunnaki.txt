Content: On the verge of the year 2012 and the re-discovery of ancient Stargate technology, investigative mythologist and author William Henry explores the Mayan prophecies that claim the birth of a new era in human evolution in a compelling documentary that takes viewers beyond the realms of the normal and into a world of supernatural wonder. Many believe that the lost technology of the gods will return by the year 2012, and that along with the re-appearance of the mythical Cloak of the Illuminati, mankind will once again possess the ability to explore new and exciting worlds. In addition to offering compelling evidence as to the existence of stargates and wormholes in the ancient world, Henry explores myth and scripture to show how even Elijah, Mary, and Jesus may have once donned the supernaturally protective Cloak of the Illuminati in order to travel safely though the stargate.
