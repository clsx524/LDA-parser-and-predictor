Content: In this sci-fi film, a Venusian emissary and an earth woman become friends. The alien tells her that he has come to warn her of the dangers of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately very few earthlings listen to his message. The film is basically a cheap knock-off of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
