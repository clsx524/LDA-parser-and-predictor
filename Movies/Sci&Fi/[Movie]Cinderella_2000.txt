Content: This soft-core, tuneful retelling of the enduring romantic fairy tale from Al Adamson is set in the year 2047, a time when men and women are not allowed to touch and the only way to have sex is via computer. In this version, Cinderella meets her charming prince at an orgy. The two click and have a wonderful time, but she must leave. Unfortunately, she forgets something (no, not a shoe). Now the smitten prince must intimately "search" a number of young women to find his true lover. Songs include "Doin' Without" and "We All Need Love."
