Content: The Day of the Flyers celebration is fast approaching, and as Petrie the pterodactyl prepares to master the art of flight the stage is set for a prehistoric adventure that will delight viewers of all ages. Soaring the skies just isn't as easy as some dinosaurs make it appear to be, but thankfully for Petrie a little help is soon to arrive in the form of a kindly creature named Guido. Ducky, Spike, Littlefoot, Cera, and, of course, Petrie, all return for the twelfth chapter in the long-running Land Before Time series.
