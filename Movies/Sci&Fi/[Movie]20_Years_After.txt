Wiki info: 
20 Years After is a 2008 American post-apocalyptic film. Filmed principally in north Alabama and southern Tennessee, the low-budget film was initially released under the title Like Moles, Like Rats, a reference to the Thornton Wilder play The Skin of Our Teeth.
The events take place 20 years after a nuclear war which was followed by plagues. No children have been born in 15 years, and people want to gain control of the first pregnant woman - Sara. Running out of water, Sara and her mother are forced to leave their shelter in Samuel's basement and join other groups of refugees who call themselves internally displaced people. Michael is a disc jockey who operates a radio station at one of the camps. David runs a gang of looters.
