Content: Season Three of USA Network's sci-fi thriller The 4400 largely focuses on the surviving members of a group of 4400 people who, after being abducted from the earth over a sixty-year period, suddenly reappeared in a bolt of light in the year 2004--only to be systematically eliminated by the US Government when it was discovered that many of "The 4400" have developed paranormal powers which, if used improperly, could destroy all mankind. Since the previous season, the National Threat Assessment Command (NTAC) has been forced to back off on its campaign of "ethnic cleansing", but not before the radical Nova group, comprised of a band of "4400" rebels, carry out a master plan to take over the world. Forming a united front against the Nova group are the "good" 4400 members, as well as NTAC agents Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch) and Diana Skouris (Jacqueline McKenzie). Meanwhile, the infant Isabelle, whose blood contains the antidote for the "promicin inhibitor" that has been used to decimate The 4400, has suddenly grown into womanhood (she is played this season by Megalyn Echikunwoke) and remains a fugitive, not only from the Government but also from the Nova group. Many of the episodes this season detail the growing relationship between Isabelle and the kindly 4400 Shawn Farrell, who has the power (albeit limited) to revive the dead. As the season progresses, it is revealed to the viewer that the supposedly "martyred" Jordan Collier, an early leading light of the 4400, is still alive, calling the shots behind the revolt against humanity. Even so, Tom's son Kyle remains in prison for fulfilling his mission of assassinating Collier--a mission determined by the futuristic earthlings who'd originally abducted the 4400 as part of a long-range plan to save the world from total annihilation!
