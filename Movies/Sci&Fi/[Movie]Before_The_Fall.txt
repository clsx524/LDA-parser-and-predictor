Content: Filmmaker F. Javier Gutierrez crafts this apocalyptic thriller that finds panic sweeping the world after the Secretary General of the United Nations announces that a meteorite will wipe out all life on Earth in just seventy-two hours. Life as we know it is about to end. Mankind made a good run of it, but now destruction is about to rain down from outer space; wiping the slate clean for a new era. While most folks react to the grim announcement by rioting in the streets, a young man named Ale decides to spend his last three days getting drunk and listening to his favorite records. Ale lives in the remote town of Laguna with his mother, and earns his living by performing a series of thankless odd jobs around town. Now, as crime soars, suicide rates shoot through the roof, and panicked hordes greet Armageddon with guns blazing, Ale's mother Rosa announces that she has decided to spend her final hours with Ale's brother Tomas and his family on the outskirts of town. But the journey to Tomas' house won't be an easy one, because in all the chaos a number of convicts have managed to escape from prison and now set about terrorizing everyone unfortunate enough to cross their paths. One criminal in particular seems intimately tied to Tomas' past. When Rosa arrives at Tomas' home to find the children all alone and cowering in fear, Ale's plans of drinking his way though the apocalypse quickly take a back seat as he races to protect the children from a horrifying fate at the hands of sadistic marauders.
