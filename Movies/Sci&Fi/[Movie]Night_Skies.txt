Content: Demons at the Door director Roy Knyrim draws inspiration from one of the most high-profile UFO sightings ever recorded for this fact-based sci-fi thriller that recreates the infamous "Phoenix Lights" case. On March 13, 1997, community leaders, law enforcement officials, and countless everyday citizens in the southwestern United States witness a phenomenon that simply couldn't be dismissed by even the most hardened of skeptics. Jason Connery, Ashley Peldon, A.J. Cook, and Gwendoline Yeo star in a film that draws on transcripts taken during hypno-therapy sessions to explore precisely what happened to six strangers stranded on a forgotten road during that fateful close encounter.
