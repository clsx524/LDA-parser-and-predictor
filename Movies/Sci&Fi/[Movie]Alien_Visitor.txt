Content: A beautiful alien is sent from the planet Epsilon to pass judgment on the shameful way in which humans have mishandled their planet. Set in a near future in which humanity has made great strides in cleaning up the Earth, it begins as a grandmother tells her granddaughters a story from the past. Her tale begins in the desert outback during the dark times when people were actively ruining their planet. The naked alien is placed upon the desert where she eventually meets a surveyor who quickly gives her some clothing. As the two travel across the land, the alien constantly admonishes him for his race's carelessness and greed. She informs him that other intelligent life forms consider humans hopeless failures. Using her ability to travel instantly to any of Earth's locales, she takes the bewildered surveyor on a whirlwind tour to prove her point. 
Wiki info: 
Epsilon (also titled Alien Visitor) is a 1995 science fiction film that was directed by Rolf de Heer. It features Ulli Birve and Syd Brisbane (and Aletha McGrath, but in the 1997 version only) . The extended version of the film runs for 92 minutes and was distributed by Miramax.
The film tells the story of a young female (Birve) that was sent from the planet Epsilon to judge how humans have managed the planet. She crash lands naked in a desert, but is found by a surveyor (Brisbane) who gives her some clothes. She informs the surveyor that other alien races consider humans to be failures that suffer from carelessness and greed. She has the ability to transport herself and the surveyor instantly to any location, and she uses this to demonstrate her point. Eventually the two fall in love.
De Heer came up with the idea for the film while driving to dinner at a friend's house. Filming took over eight months.
