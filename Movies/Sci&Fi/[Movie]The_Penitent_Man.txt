Content: An analyst isn't certain if one of his patients is delusional or in possession of visionary technology in this independent sci-fi drama. Dr. Jason Pyatt (Lathrop Walker) is a psychiatrist who is struggling with the stress of severe financial problems and a troubled relationship with his wife Evelyn (Melissa Roberts), who is expecting a child. One of Pyatt's patients is Mr. Darnell (Lance Henriksen), who one day shares a startling secret -- he has discovered a device that allows him to travel through time, and the gadget has brought him nothing but grief as he's become aware of great catastrophes waiting in the future. Pyatt doesn't believe Darnell at first, but as he discusses the concept of time travel with his friend Ovid (Andrew Keegan), the notion no longer seems so ludicrous, and the doctor confronts the possibility Darnell has chosen to share his story with him for a specific reason. The Penitent Man was an official selection at the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival.
