Content: A botched science experiment unleashes a destructive otherworldly force with the power to devour the planet in this science fiction disaster thriller starring Judd Nelson and Kristy Swanson. Science has finally gone too far, and as a giant black hole opens up over St. Louis, the terrified denizens struggle to escape the all-consuming void by any means necessary. As General Ryker (David Selby) prepares to lob a heaping helping of nuclear warheads at the rapidly expanding hole, scientist Eric Bryce (Nelson) and his assistant Shannon (Swanson) soon discover that the hole has also provided passage for an interstellar stalker of the most unsavory variety. Now, with a murderous alien on the loose and the fate of the world looking grimmer by the minute, Eric and Shannon must destroy the savage visitor and reverse the effects of the black hole before the increasingly unstable General Ryker carries out his explosive final solution. 
Wiki info: 
The Black Hole is a television movie produced for the Sci Fi channel, directed by Tibor Takacs.
Something goes awry at a particle accelerator facility in St. Louis and a black hole begins to form. A creature exits the hole and seeks out energy. As the creature absorbs energy, the black hole grows in size and destroys a large part of St. Louis. Before the creature can be hit with a nuclear bomb, it is lured back to the black hole and the black hole collapses on itself.
The film is noteworthy for using many distinctive pieces of St. Louis architecture as locations in the story. The Saint Louis Science Center planetarium stands in as the headquarters for the research project, and the Gateway Arch is destroyed in one scene as is Busch Memorial Stadium and the city hall.
