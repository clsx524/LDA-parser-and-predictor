Content: The low-budget, sci-fi telemovie Earthstorm opens with an interstellar catastrophe. A massive asteroid slams into the moon, dramatically altering the Earth's ocean tides and triggering sweeping storms. At closer glance, however, scientists learn that the moon's structure is now entirely unstable and that large chunks of it will soon fly off and hit the Earth, damaging all life on that planet. With no other answer in sight, scientists solicit the help of a demolitions man (Stephen Baldwin), who promises to devise a workable solution.
