Cast: 
Content: This speculative TV movie is set in the year 2008, as grief-stricken married couple Skye (Elizabeth Perkins) and Rick (Bradley Whitford) struggle bravely to overcome the death of their son. "Shock" is hardly the appropriate word to describe the couple's reaction when they meet another child who looks exactly like their own boy. It soon develops that Skye and Rick's son was the product of "Baby 2000," a top-secret -- and highly illegal -- cloning experiment conducted at a fertility clinic. Will the couple blow the whistle on the clinic's crooked activities, or will they be mollified into silence by being given an exact duplicate of the son they have lost? Refreshingly, the man responsible for the experiment, Dr. Wesley Kozak (Alan Rosenberg) is not portrayed as a Frankensteinish villain, but instead as a compassionate, concerned scientist who truly believes that "Baby 2000" has been conceived for the benefit of humankind. Cloned originally aired September 28, 1997, on ABC.
