Content: In the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the city of Camelot plays a vital role, as the seat of power for the wise and mighty king as well as a place of beauty and solace that a great man would gladly call home. But while King Arthur and many of his Knights were at least inspired by characters in real life, it's long been a matter of debate if there really was a Camelot -- and if so, where it was and what it was like. The Legend of King Arthur: Camelot is a documentary which explores the myth and conventional wisdom about the fabled city, as well as historical and archeological research which attempts to clarify if Camelot did indeed have some basis in fact.
