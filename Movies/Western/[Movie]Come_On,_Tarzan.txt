Director: Alan James
Cast: 
Content: Ken Maynard's magnificent horse Tarzan took center-stage in this, perhaps the star's most flamboyant entry in the otherwise super low-budget KBS series. A wild stallion, Tarzan releases a group of horses corralled for slaughter by nasty Steve Frazer (Niles Welch), who is selling horseflesh to pet food manufacturers. When Frazer demands that the sheriff (Jack Rockwell) intervene, foreman Ken Benson (Maynard) convinces rancher Patricia Riley (Merna Kennedy) to help him prove Tarzan innocent. Dubious at first, Patricia finally comes around and together they get the goods on Frazer, who is eventually killed by a vengeful Tarzan.
