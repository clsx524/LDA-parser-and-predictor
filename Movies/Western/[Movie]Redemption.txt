Content: Director Robert Conway crafts this genre busting western set in a lawless town where outlaws and marked-men go to elude justice and live out the rest of their days in peace. Somewhere along the Mexico border exists an old mining town called Redemption. Founded by Quakers in the mid-1800s, Redemption quickly gained a reputation as being the place to go if you're looking to escape the long arm of the law. Frank Hardin (Dustin James) is just such a man. A former cattle rustler who relied on dishonesty and a six-shooter in order to get by, Frank arrives in Redemption and witnesses a deed so abominable that it shakes him to his very core. Repulsed that he was advertently a part of the transgression and fearing for his immortal soul, the man who once cast the law aside attempts to summon deliverance by righting that terrible wrong before his number comes up.
