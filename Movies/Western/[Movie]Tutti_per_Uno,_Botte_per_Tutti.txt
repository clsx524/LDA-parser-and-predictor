Released Year: 1972
Running time: 93
Director: Bruno Corbucci
Cast: 
Content: Familiar Italian character actor Giancarlo Prete (here using the pseudonym "Timothy Brent") helps a trio of Texas Rangers escort a spy (Karin Schubert) to Mexico in this routine spaghetti Western from Bruno Corbucci who wrote the far superior genre classic Django. Future porn star Schubert has a nude scene, and the cult cast may draw some (co-star Luigi Montefiore later starred as Antropophagus for Aristide Massaccesi), but this one is for devotees only. With Eduardo Fajardo, Cris Huerta, and Carlo Rustichelli, who also composed the peculiarly eclectic score.
