Cast: 
Content: A tough bounty hunter and his conniving thrall clash with a gang of supernatural killers while searching for a mythical cache of gold in the Wild West. Butch (John Elliot) is a rare breed - a bounty hunter with a sense of honor. The same can certainly not be said of Rattler Fenton, a ruthless renegade who values gold above human life, and who's currently serving as Butch's galley slave. Joined in their quest by an eccentric collection of outlaws that includes the lovely-but-deadly Akemi (Narisa Suzuki), the weary travelers find their quest for gold complicated when they become the target of the dreaded Mondego gang, a group of cold-blooded killers that seem to draw their power from an otherworldly force.
