Cast: 
Content: The newly arrived sheriff of a dusty western town works to convict his predecessor's killer and identify the culprit who murdered a local girl's father in cold blood. Dispatched to clean up a small town that has been taken over by sadistic rancher Rod Edwards (Joseph Calvo), Oklahoma Dan (Rick Horn) begins to suspect that Rod's ruthless ranch hands were the ones who expressed their displeasure of the former sheriff with a well-placed bullet. Gathering enough evidence to convict foreman Hondo (Charles Alberty) and Rod's son Jim (George Herzig) of the crime won't be easy, and to make matters worse the man who shot Georgiana White's (Sabine Bethmann) father is still walking free. With the help of his faithful deputies, however, Dan just might be able to toss the book at a corrupt local banker (Tom Felleghy) and unearth the evidence that ties all the recent crimes together.
