Content: A soldier on the run from the union army and a lovelorn cowboy (Chris Kattan) find their flight from a corrupt old west sheriff complicated by the onslaught of a stammering horde of cannibalistic zombies in a hybrid horror comedy western from director Glasgow Phillips. Elmer Winslow (James Denton) and Luke Budd (Chris Kattan) are two misfits with no place in society. After fleecing a crooked lawman for all he's worth, these two lawless drifters discover that a mysterious plague is turning upstanding everyday people into mindless ghouls with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. As the dead begin to rise from the earth and all hope of escape from this barren wasteland begins to look as bleak as the landscape itself, the appearance of Geronimo's beautiful niece provides the pair with just the motivation needed to break free from the cold wet grip of the living dead.
