Content: A dashing American is falsely accused of being an outlaw by his rival in this polished silent Western starring Fred Thomson, a former Army chaplain. Imprisoned in Mexico, Dave Marshall (Thomson) makes a daring escape, just in time to prevent his famous horse Silver King from being gored in the bullring. Together, Marshall and Silver King defeat the bull, American style. In front of a cheering Mexican crowd, Don Juan Estrada (Charles Hill Mailes) consents to a marriage between his daughter, Carmelita (Ann May), and Marshall, while the rival, Luke Severn (William Lowery) is shipped off to prison.
