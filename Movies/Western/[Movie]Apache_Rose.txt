Content: Apache Rose is a "typical" Roy Rogers-Dale Evans musical western: few surprises, but plenty of entertainment value. Rogers plays an oil man who hopes to get drilling rights to an old Spanish settlement in California. The villains plot to grab up the land from themselves, exploiting a handful of highly suspect IOU's for that purpose. Much of the plot hinges on a gambling boat owned by Billie Colby (Dale Evans), a setting which offers plenty of opportunity for a steady stream of musical numbers. A tense, action-filled climax caps this delightful diversion.
