Content: Designed for the regional family trade, Pony Express Rider is a fond harkback to the Saturday afternoon westerns of old.

The supporting cast is populated with such always-welcome reliables as Joan Caulfield, Henry Wilcoxon, Ken Curtis, Slim Pickens and Dub Taylor. Pony Express Rider was directed by Robert J. Totten, a specialist in episodic television horse operas.
