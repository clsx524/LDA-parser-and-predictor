Content: One man takes a stand against a vicious robber baron and his ruthless crew of cutthroats in this western set in the Sierra Mountains, and starring Michael Madsen. The year is 1887. Upon losing his home and his wife, former Civil War sharpshooter William Drayton disappears into the high country. He thought his daughter Elizabeth was dead, but he was wrong. When she finds him, they decide to start a new life together. Unfortunately peace isn't in the cards to Drayton, because power-hungry former banker Horace Scarsdale is determined to get rich by becoming a railroad tycoon, and anyone who stands in his way must answer to "The Company Men." When no one in town dares stand up to Scarsdale's thugs, Drayton realizes he's walked out of one war, and straight into another.
