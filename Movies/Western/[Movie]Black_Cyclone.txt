Black_Cyclone
Released Year: 1925
Running time: 67
Director: Fred Jackman, Sr.
Cast: 
Content: Silent screen cowboy Guinn "Big Boy" Williams and lovely Kathleen Collins (Mrs. Williams in real life) take a back seat to an unusual equine love triangle in this off-beat action thriller. Rex the Wonder Horse is really the film's leading "man," with the mare Lady as the "damsel in distress" and a black horse named "Killer" "acting" the "other man." Comedy producer Hal Roach dabbled in the western genre during the final years of silents, and Black Cyclone was perhaps his finest.
