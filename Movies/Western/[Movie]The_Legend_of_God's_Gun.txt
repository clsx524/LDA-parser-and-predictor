Wiki info: 
The Legend Of Godâ€™s Gun is a 2008 American independently produced film celebrating the tradition of western films and the spirit of Rock and Roll. The film is actually based on the psychedelic Western album of the same name by the band Spindrift--the album having preceded the production of the film by a number of years.
A gun-slinging preacher returns to the debaucherous town of Playa Diablo seeking revenge from the notorious scorpion-venom drinking bandito El Sobero, a descendent of a disciple of King Tavatta--the Scorpion King from the ancient world. El Sobero and his band of bad banditos are also returning to Playa Diablo seeking their own revenge against the town sheriff for putting a bounty on their heads and subsequently shooting all of their horses. With the Bounty Hunter dragging up slowly behind there is sure to be a confrontation of Biblical proportions as they all meet in the circle of death. This is The Legend Of God's Gun.
