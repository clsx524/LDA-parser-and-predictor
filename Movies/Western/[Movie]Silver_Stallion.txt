Content: Stuntman extraordinaire David Sharpe is the human star of the adventure quickie Silver Stallion. The bulk of the story, however, is carried by the title horse, who is forced to defend himself and his turf against the villainous Black Stallion (played by Black Jack). Silver Stallion's best friend turns out to be a police dog named Captain Boots. Meanwhile, aspiring horse-thief Davey (Sharpe) is dissuaded from his intention to pilfer the Silver Stallion by the love of a good woman named Jan. The ingenue role is filled by radio actress Janet Waldo, who was still active in the 1990s as the voice of cartoon heroine Judy Jetson.
