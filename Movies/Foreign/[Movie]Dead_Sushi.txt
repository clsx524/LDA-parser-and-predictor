Content: A famed sushi chef's daughter runs away to a remote hot springs inn after getting fed up with her father's ultra-strict working habits, and uses her many years of training to save the lives of the guests when a twisted former researcher perfects a method of creating killer sushi. Keiko's father is one of the most respected sushi chefs in Japan. He always gives 110%, and he expects the same from his daughter. Determined to live life on her own terms, Keiko lands a job at a serine inn surrounded by soothing hot springs. Unfortunately for her, both the employees and the pharmaceutical specialists staying there on a work retreat take no small amount of pleasure in mocking the new addition to the staff. But when a disgruntled former employee of the firm shows up at the inn with a bizarre formula that transforms delicious sushi into rampaging monsters, only Keiko and her unique skill set can save them all from being eaten alive.
