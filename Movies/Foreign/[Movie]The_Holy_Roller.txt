Content: This direct-to-video Christian drama concerns Pastor Luke, a minister blessed with rare gifts that enable him to inspire others. Sadly, though, his small-town congregation isn't large enough to fully benefit from this. Guided by the conviction that he's doing God's will, Luke moves to a densely-populated urban area and achieves fame as a televangelist, but a series of personal crises arise, help shape his character and turn him into the man the Lord truly wants him to be. The supporting cast includes Jeremy Brennan and Victoria Abbott.
