Content: A man sees things in a whole new way after he's forced into a life of crime in this thriller from Thai filmmaker Pen-ek Ratanaruang. Tul (Nopachai "Peter" Jayanama) was a policeman before he fell under the sway of powerful crime boss Demon, who embraces a philosophy that human nature is rooted in evil rather than good. Demon and his underlings have fabricated evidence that Tul is involved in drug dealing and murder, and they're blackmailing the cop into doing their bidding. Tul becomes an assassin for Demon, and he's ordered to kill a powerful local politician. Posing as a Buddhist monk, he carries out the assignment, but gets caught in the cross fire with police and bodyguards and takes a bullet in the head. When he's released from the hospital three months later, his vision has turned upside down, and he struggles to clear his name while tracking down the men who betrayed him. Fon Tok Kuen Fah (aka Headshot) received its North American premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.
