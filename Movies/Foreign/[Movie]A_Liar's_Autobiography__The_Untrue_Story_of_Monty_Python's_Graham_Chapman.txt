Content: Drawing inspiration from the late Graham Chapman's intentionally fictitious memoir A Liar's Autobiography (Volume VI, filmmakers Jeffrey Simpson, Ben Timlett, and Bill Jones employ 15 teams of animators to tell the outlandish and surreal life story of the Monty Python's Flying Circus member who died of cancer in 1989. With newly discovered audio recordings allowing the celebrated comedian to tell his life story in his own words, A Liar's Autobiography - The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman offers a humorous, and largely untrue, look at a venerable icon of comedy.
