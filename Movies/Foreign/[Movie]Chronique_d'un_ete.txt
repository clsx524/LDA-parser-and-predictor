Content: Originally Chronique d'Un Ete, this black & white, 16-millimeter film is an exercise in cinema verite, conceived by an anthropologistmoviemaker (Jean Rouch) and a sociologistmovie critic (Edgar Morin). The all-amateur cast includes a black university student, a factory worker and a young holocaust survivor. Each is interviewed on a variety of current-events topics, and each is permitted to ramble on until the camera runs out of film. As a coda, the interviewees are seen talking among themselves, asking each other if they had been "acting" while on camera.
