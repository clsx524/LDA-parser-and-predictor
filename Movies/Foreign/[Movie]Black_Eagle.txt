Ken Tami along with the assistance of his brave two young sons and his female CIA aide Patricia Parker (Doran Clark) must track down the tracking device before all ends, as Ken inevitably comes face to face with an unknown skilled enemy in the form of a KGB team leader named Andrei (Jean-Claude Van Damme).
