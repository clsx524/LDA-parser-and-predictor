Content: Four party girls fight for their lives after enjoying a wild night out on the town, and calling the wrong guy for a ride home in this vicious slasher film from Australia. Gemma, Leah, Michelle and Susan have all been friends since they were kids. They like to get wild, and that's exactly what happens when they head out for some club-hopping. Meanwhile, brutal ex-cons Brett and John have embarked on a brutal killing spree after being released from prison. They think they've found their next victim in bullied misfit William when they learn of his troubled background, and help him seek brutal revenge on his tormentors. Later, when the girls are done partying, Michelle whips out her phone and dials random number looking for a ride home. Unfortunately for them, they may never reach their destination because they've called Michael, and he's bringing his two new friends along for the ride. When the situation in the car turns tense, Michael decides that he's done being taken advantage of, and gives Brett and John the cue to unleash hell. As the knives come out and the blood starts to flow, the question of who will end up dead, and who will survive to see dawn is anyone's guess.
