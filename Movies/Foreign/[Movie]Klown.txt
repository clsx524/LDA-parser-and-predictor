Cast: 
Content: Wannabe father figure Frank (Frank Hvam) and his debauched best friend Casper (Casper Christensen) embark on a hedonistic weekend canoeing trip, and bring a wide-eyed 12-year-old along for the ride in this raunchy yet affectionate comedy from Denmark. Eager to prove that he has what it takes to be a responsible parent, misguided Frank snatches his pregnant girlfriend's adolescent nephew and heads out for a weekend of male bonding in the wilderness. But Frank's best friend Casper isn't about to let the presence of a child get in the way of his adulterous escapades. However, when fun with prostitutes leads to armed robbery, prison, and worse, it soon becomes apparent that irresponsible Frank isn't even capable of looking after himself, much less a 12-year-old child.
