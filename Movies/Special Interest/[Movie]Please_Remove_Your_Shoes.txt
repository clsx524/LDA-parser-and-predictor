Content: Troubled by the realization that the ballooning size and influence of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has failed to make air travel any safer than it was before 911, pilot and aviation publisher Fred Gevalt teams with director Rob DelGaudio to expose the incompetence and corruption within the increasingly powerful federal agency. Formed in late 2001, the TSA is an organization dedicated to ensuring that the skies over the United States remain safe and secure. Yet despite increasingly restrictive rules that make airplane travel a nightmare for the average American, the TSA has failed to become the effective force it was envisioned as thanks to power abuse, secrecy, overt failure to follow the agency charter, and deplorable mismanagement. Candid conversations with federal air marshals, airport security agents, and various others who have worked in and around the TSA reveal why the agency is entirely deserving of its reputation for being completely superfluous.
