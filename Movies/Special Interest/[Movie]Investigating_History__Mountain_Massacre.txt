Content: A series of tragic events dramatized in the notorious Christopher Cain western September Dawn (2007) gets a more earnest documentary exploration in this program from cable's History Channel. The film takes us back to the fateful day of September 11, 1857, when a wagon train populated by 120 travelers in the mountains of Southern Utah was thoroughly and bloodily butchered. For over a century, this crime went unsolved and unaddressed, but this program attempts to unearth some of the grisly and haunting details. It tells how the members of the Fancher-Baker wagon train, seemingly peaceful and well-meaning settlers, were set upon by a tribe of violent Paiute Indians. The pioneers defended themselves for five days, when a Mormon Militia appeared, asked them to surrender their arms - and promptly massacred everyone in sight. Much of the truth about these events came to light in 1999, when a Utah backhoe operator inadvertently dug up a mass grave filled with the remains of the Fanchers and Bakers. Then, just as suddenly, Utah's governor insisted that the bones be reinterred. This film asks key questions about the secrets that lay buried in the grave, and the governor's reasons for closing the investigation.
