Content: Truth proves to be far stranger than fiction when Emmy award-winning television producer Phil Rosenthal answers the call to fly halfway across the globe and adapt his hit television series Everybody Loves Raymond for Russian television. Arriving in Moscow, Rosenthal is greeted by television producers who don't seem to understand his sense of humor, and don't appear particularly eager to receive his input. As his collaboration gets under way, however, Rosenthal quickly realizes that the unusual circumstances surrounding his voyage have all the makings of a classic fish-out-of-water comedy.
