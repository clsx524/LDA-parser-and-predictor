Content: Join filmmaker Douglas Tirola as he explores the poker renaissance by taking us from America's living rooms to Las Vegas' lavish casinos, where novice gamers mix with seasoned card sharks. Back in the early '80s, card tables were commonplace in suburban living rooms. By the end of the decade, poker had fallen out of favor, and no one was playing. Today poker isn't merely a game, but a lifestyle. In this documentary, interviews with casual players, committed gamers, and celebrity card slingers like Matt Damon and Jennifer Tilly reveal why the game of poker is back in fashion, and bigger than ever.
