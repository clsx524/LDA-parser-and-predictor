Content: Filmmaker Denis Cote presents a witty but telling portrait of a man who has built a life out of what other people throw away in this documentary. Jean-Paul Colmor is in his mid-70's and lives on a plot of land in Saint Amable, not far from Montreal. Colmor collects what most people think of as junk -- old cars that don't run, scrap metal and other detritus of the industrial age -- and he spends his days taking apart other people's trash and selling or recycling what's useful to support himself and maintain his modest home. Colmor has been able to satisfy his simple needs by sorting what's of value from what's not for years now, and while he's been happy enough living on his own, he faces a new challenge when he's asked to share his home with a handful of developmentally disabled teenagers. Carcasses was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.
