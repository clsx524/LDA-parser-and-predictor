Content: Filmmaker David Bond explores the practical issues of privacy in a world of prying electronic eyes in this documentary. As the public and private sectors stockpile more data on ordinary citizens and a growing number of people are willing to share the details of their lives on line, how secure is an average individual? Bond decided to find out -- he opted to "disappear" for a month, and hired a detective firm to find him. The detectives had nothing to go on but Bond's name, but before long they knew where he lived, where his father lived, that his wife was pregnant and could easily track Bond to most of his hiding places as he struggled to outsmart them. Erasing David exposes the realities of our culture of surveillance as well as Bond's mounting anxieties as he learns how few secrets he (and most people like him) truly have. Erasing David received its North American premiere at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival.
