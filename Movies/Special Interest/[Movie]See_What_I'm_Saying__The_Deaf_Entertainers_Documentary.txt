Content: Follow the journeys of four deaf entertainers who refuse to be held back by their common disability. Actor Robert DeMayo specializes in translating English to American Sign Language and teaches at Juilliard. Rendered homeless following a miscommunication with his landlord, DeMayo wages a daily struggle to get back on his feet. Drummer Bob Hiltermann pounds the skins for Beethoven's Nightmare, a deaf rock band that's been going strong for three decades, and has recently begun preparations for the biggest concert of their career. TL Forsberg falls somewhere between two worlds; she can hear well enough that she doesn't qualify as deaf, yet wages a daily struggle to be accepted by mainstream society. When Forsberg opens for Beethoven's Nightmare, her fate takes a sudden and remarkable twist. Meanwhile, deaf African-American comic CJ Jones has achieved noteworthy success in the deaf community, but fails to break through into the mainstream standup circuit. When Jones becomes the producer of Los Angeles' inaugural International Sign Language Theater Festival, an interesting opportunity opens up for down-on-his-luck thespian DeMayo.
