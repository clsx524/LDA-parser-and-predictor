Content: Liam Neeson narrates director Anthony Geffen's documentary exploring the mystery of famed British adventurer George Mallory, who -- along with fellow climber Sandy Irvine -- perished while attempting to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1924. Eight years after discovering Mallory's preserved body in one of the most treacherous areas of the mountain, American climber Conrad Anker teams with British mountaineer Leo Houlding to retrace Mallory's footsteps on the North East Ridge Route, free climbing in areas of the mountain that have since been outfitted with ladders despite the risk of injury or death. Alan Rickman, Hugh Dancy, and Ralph Fiennes provide additional narration.
