Released Year: 2009

Director: Henri de Gerlache
Cast: 
Content: Belgian surrealist painter Rene Magritte (1898-1967) epitomized the iconoclastic and the unclassifiable, so fittingly, the treatment of the artist afforded to him in this documentary checks in as both, as well. In lieu of essaying a straightforward biographical treatment, director Henri de Gerlache casts Charlie Dupont as an actor hired to play Magritte, who then begins exhaustively researching the painter's life and work and uncovering the meaning of one painting after another. As the various facts and insights about the figure come to light, de Gerlache intercuts his dramatic narrative with more straightforward documentary elements, such as cutaway interviews with art historians and experts - among them, photographer Duane Michals.
