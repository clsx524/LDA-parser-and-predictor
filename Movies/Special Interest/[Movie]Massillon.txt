Cast: 
Content: Director William E. Jones helms this autobiographical documentary about his own journey, coming of age as a gay man in the Rust Belt town of Massillion, Ohio. Telling the story without any onscreen participants, the movie details not only Jones' story, but that of the town, as well as the history of sexual persecution in the U.S. Interestingly, Jones utilizes only voiceover narration to articulate the thesis of the film, pairing the storytelling with an ongoing series of creative images, from historical photographs, to expressionist graphic art.
