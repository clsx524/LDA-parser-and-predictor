Content: This documentary contains a lecture by Noam Chomsky where he delineates how the United States foreign policy in Iran, as well as the actions taken in the Middle East, actually act against the best interests of American business, but do fit in line with what he considers the "Mafia Principle," a theory that he believes explains how the United States desires obedience above all else.
