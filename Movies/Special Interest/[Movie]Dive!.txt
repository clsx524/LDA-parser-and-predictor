Content: Jeremy Seifert's muckraking documentary rests on a sad and jarring fact: each year, Americans discard around 96 billion pounds of edible food, and send it directly to landfills - when hundreds of countries around the world exist below the poverty line. In Dive!, Seifert and co. go "dumpster diving" in the back-alley receptacles of L.A.-area supermarkets. During their journey, they manage to retrieve thousands of dollars worth of decent food, which raises vital questions about why such waste continues to occur, while numerous overseas populations starve.
