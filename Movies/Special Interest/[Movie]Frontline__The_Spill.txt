Content: Hindsight is 2020, but in the case of Frontline: The Spill, even that might not be enough when going up against a powerful corporation focused on profit. The PBS series Frontline and ProPublica look into the details leading up to and surrounding the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill, including a multitude of safety failures. One case in particular, a 2005 accident at the Texas City, TX, refinery, exhibits the result of cost-cutting efforts and profit boosting that left 15 dead and 170 injured.
