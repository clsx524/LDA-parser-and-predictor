Content: This historical documentary offers an account of the all black crew who manned the Pea Island Lifesaving Station located on the Outer Banks barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina, and were personally responsible for rescuing countless sailors who would otherwise have lost their lives in the harsh Atlantic - especially on the night of October 11, 1896, when the Pea Island crew's courage against the hurricane level winds laid the groundwork for what would come to be known as the U.S. Coast Guard.
