Content: This historical documentary tells the story of the infamous Sonewall Uprising -- a police raid launched on a Mafia-run gay bar in Greenwich Village in the early '60s -- not for its ties to the Mafia, but for its ties to the gay community. Saddled with prejudice and oppression at every other turn in conservative society, the gays and lesbians did something unprecedented in response to the raid, by fighting back.
