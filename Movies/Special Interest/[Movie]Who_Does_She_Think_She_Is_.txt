Content: In the post-sexual-revolutionary world, women often find themselves pressured to choose between working and full-time motherhood. This documentary from filmmaker Pamela Tanner Boll follows five artistic women who have rejected the notion of career and family being an either or decision. The film takes a hard look at the difficulties of having taken this position, such as the role of their various art forms and creative outlets in their day-to-day lives, and finding the balance between career and family.
