Content: Director Ian Cheney explores the hard work involved in going green with this documentary focusing on the construction of Boston's first green residential high-rise, the Macallen. Snuggled comfortably in the working-class neighborhood of South Boston, the Macallen was a building that was constructed with the goal of receiving a Gold LEED rating from the U.S. Green Building Council. While the occasional setback caused many members of the construction crew to doubt the designers would meet their ambitious goal, the outcome of the project surprised both skeptics and believers alike.
