Content: Documentary filmmaker Joshua Grossberg turns his lens on Plantation, Florida loan officer and family man Dan Sheffer, whose benevolent efforts to help Hurricane Katrina evacuees start new lives in the Sunshine State yielded some unanticipated results. In the aftermath of the storm, Sheffer was deeply saddened by the nightly images of desperate New Orleans natives being herded into the Houston Astrodome. Inspired by the actions of a Good Samaritan from his own state, Sheffer determined to travel to New Orleans and extend a lifeline to anyone who would accept. After Sheffer raised the funds needed to cover the air fare for 10 evacuees to fly from Houston to Florida, he personally flew to the Astrodome to find recruits, and oversee the operation. But convincing the evacuees of his noble intentions would prove no simple task, and though not all of their stories had happy endings, the individuals who took Sheffer up on his offer would all discover that in times of crisis, sometimes help can come from the most unlikely of places.
