Content: 20 year old Nathan (Bradley Dorsey) uses the loss of his job and break-up with his girlfriend as the motivators to find his biological mother, who gave him up shortly after birth before vanishing without a trace. Upon returning to his hometown, Nathan checks into a local hotel, where wise housekeeper Mave (Della Reese) offers some kind words of encouragement. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with another guest (Kristen Renton) reinforces Nathan's determination to succeed, and before long he's managed to track down his mother's address. Two decades after making the most painful decision of her life, Nathan's mother Linda (Erika Eleniak) still carries the guilt of giving him up for adoption. As she attempts to pay penance by convincing pregnant teen Tori (Erin Sossoman) not to get an abortion, Nathan returns into her life, in the process unearthing a painful secret that sheds new light on his reason for being.
