In 1968, America was divided over the Vietnam War. Due to the growing anti-war movement, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election. Democrat Robert Kennedy, the Presidential hopeful, was assassinated that summer. The Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago where leaders of the anti-war movement planned a protest. During the protest, Chicago Mayor Daley used police force to brutally quell the rally, and as a result, rioting broke out in the streets. One person was killed, hundreds were injured and thousands were arrested. One year later, newly-elected President Richard Nixon gave the green light to prosecute eight men who were accused of conspiracy to incite a riot. The FBI brought them to Chicago, where they stood trial. They were known thereafter as The Chicago 8.
