Wiki info: 
The Other Son (original title: Le Fils de l'Autre) is a 2012 French drama film directed by Lorraine Levy.
The film centers on Joseph Silberg (Jules Sitruk), who is up to be 18 years old and serve to the Israeli Defense Forces. During the routine tests, his family discovers his blood type is different from theirs. Under new tests, including DNA, they find out Joseph is not their son.
An investigation is conducted by the hospital he was born and due to the bombing attack that happened on the night he was born, Joseph and another baby were taken to shelters and switched by mistake. The other family, which is also called by the hospital's director, is Palestinian. Their baby, Yacine Al Bezaaz, was born on the same night.
The story develops under the issues involving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in which both fathers are reluctant to accept the situation while the mothers are friendly to the idea of getting close to their real children. As both boys become friends, their families will have to re-evaluate their beliefs and resistance to neighbor culture prior to connect with their real identity.
