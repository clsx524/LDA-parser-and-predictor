It's been a whole year since Detective Callahan (Stephen Dorff) was rescued by a stranger during a drug bust gone awry. Ever since that day, the detective has worked hard to clean up his reputation. But his life changes forever when that mystery hero emerges from the shadows to request a favor. The local strippers have recently fallen prey to a group of men who believe they are above the law. In order to bring them to justice, Detective Calahan must take caution not to reveal how his own previous actions helped to enable the perpetrators.
