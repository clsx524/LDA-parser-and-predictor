Content: A hardened ex-con returns to his family in the Bronx and struggles to stay on the right side of the law as his overburdened wife guards a sensitive secret about their 16-year-old son. Enrique (Esai Morales) has just served three years of hard time. He's determined to reconnect with his wife Angela (Judy Reyes), whose uncharacteristic silence confuses and frustrates him as he determined to give their teenage son Michael the kind of macho swagger that will help him to survive on the streets. What Enrique fails to realize - and what his wife has struggled to keep a secret - however, is the fact that during the time his father has been in prison, Michael has began to realize that he is a woman trapped in a man's body. Now, as Michael's transformation into a woman becomes too obvious for his mother to cover up, Enrique's struggle to cast aside his machismo attitude and give his son with unconditional love leads the conflicted father down a dangerous path.
