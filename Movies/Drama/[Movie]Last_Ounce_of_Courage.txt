Content: A patriotic veteran rallies the citizens of his small town to fight back against tyranny as their rights are slowly stripped away in this politically-charged family drama. Bob Revere (Marshall Teague) knows what it's like to fight for freedom. A small-town war hero, he's heartbroken when his own son Tom loses his life defending America abroad. But Tom left behind a son of his own named Christian, and 14 years later, the young boy and his mother move back to Mount Colombus to be with their family for the holidays. Meanwhile, Christian's grandfather Bob, now the mayor of Mount Columbus, begins to notice that his country is heading in a dangerous direction, and that freedom itself is on the line. As Bob rallies the locals to awaken from their comfortable stupor and fight back against the powers that be, Christian learns that sometimes the battle for liberty begins at home.
