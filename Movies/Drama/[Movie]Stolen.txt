Content: A desperate thief has just 12 hours to steal $10 million and save his daughter from his vengeful former partner in this fast-paced action thriller reuniting Nicolas Cage and director Simon West (Con Air, The Expendables 2). Determined to get the payout for a major heist gone awry, a degenerate criminal (Josh Lucas) kidnaps the daughter (Sami Gayle) of his one-time partner-in-crime (Cage), and threatens her life if he doesn't have the money in 12 hours. Now, with the clock ticking and his daughter trapped in a random taxi being driven around New Orleans, the frantic ex-con enlists the help of a former associate (Malin Akerman) to help pull off the heist that will save his little girl's life. Danny Huston and M.C. Gainey also star. 
Wiki info: 
Stolen, formerly known as Medallion, is a film starring Nicolas Cage, Danny Huston, Malin Åkerman, M.C. Gainey, Sami Gayle, Mark Valley and Josh Lucas.
A former thief, Will Montgomery (Nicolas Cage), is released from prison for a bank robbery of $10 million. He decides to visit his estranged daughter, Alison (Sami Gayle), whom he hasn't seen in eight years. But then an old partner (Josh Lucas), who many believed to have died, kidnaps Alison and locks her in the trunk of his medallion taxi cab, and demands ransom: the $10 million he believes Will still has. Since he doesn't, Will has to rob another bank as the detective that put him away (Danny Huston) tracks him down again.
