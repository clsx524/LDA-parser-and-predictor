Content: The mystery surrounding a mute vagabond found living in the woods of a small town threatens to upset the delicate social balance of the close-knit community in this drama featuring Keith David and James Russo. Samuel Bleak was just eight-year-old when he ran away into the woods. No one ever knew why he fled from his family, and in the years that followed he was presumed dead. Then, 20-years later, Police Chief Ruben Ramirez discovers Samuel living a life of solitude in a dilapidated shanty. He won't speak, and his only possession is an old typewriter. Subsequently placed in a small mental institution, Samuel begins the long process of integrating himself back into society. But while Chief Ramirez's wife does her best to care for the taciturn young patient, his patience is tested by the constant flood of tests and questions, and the desires of a lonely female patient with an intensely jealous admirer. In time the truth about Samuel's tragic past slowly comes to light, and when it does this small town may never be the same again.
