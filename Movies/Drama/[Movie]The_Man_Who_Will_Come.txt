Content: A real life tragedy during World War II inspired this period drama from filmmaker Giorgio Diritti. Martina (Greta Zuccheri Montanari) is an eight-year-old girl growing up in Marzabotto, a small town near Bologna, in the 1940s. Martina is an sensitive and impressionable child who was struck mute by the death of her baby brother, though she seems to be improving now that her mother Lena (Maya Sansa) is expecting another child. But as Lena and Martina's father Armando (Claudio Casadio) struggle to keep the children clothed and fed, war rages in Europe, and the family has been forced to take in several relatives who've fled the fighting in the larger cities, including Armando's free spirited sister (Alba Rohrwacher) and more traditional mother (Maria Grazia Naldi). As Axis forces patrol the village, a growing number of underground resistance fighters are organizing in Marzabotto, and many citizens are torn between their support for the patriots and their fear of reprisal from German soldiers. As resistance activities simmer, the German SS arrives in Marzabotto, and Martina a witness to a massacre. L'uomo Che Verra (aka The Man Who Will Come) was an official selection at the 2009 BFI London Film Festival.
