Content: Dogtooth writerdirector Yorgos Lanthimos challenges our perception of reality once again in this darkly comic drama about a mysterious underground group who assist the bereaved in coping with death by temporarily posing as their deceased loved ones. Under the leadership of their coach Mont Blanc (Aris Servetalis), the members of ALPS memorize various phrases spoken by the dearly departed, perfect their distinctive mannerisms, and spend time with their grieving families until the acceptance of loss eventually sets in. Following the sudden death of a talented tennis star, sympathetic hospital nurse and ALPS member Monte Rosa (Aggeliki Papoulia) secretly offers her services to the woman's family. Little does Monte Rosa realize her clandestine work with the deceased athlete's family has put her career with ALPS in serious jeopardy.
