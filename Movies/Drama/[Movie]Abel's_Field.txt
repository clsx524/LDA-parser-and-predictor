Content: This inspirational religious drama concerns Seth (Samuel Davis) a Middle American teenager. When his mother dies and his father abandons the family, Seth must juggle raising his twin sisters, attending classes and working two jobs - a load that leaves him more than a little overwhelmed. After the young man becomes implicated in a fight, he's forced to do service work with the high school groundskeeper, Abel (Kevin Sorbo); initially they hate each other, but over time the walls between them begin to collapse and the men find redemption and solace in their new friendship. As difficulties surface on Seth's end - including a forced eviction for all three children - a long-buried secret from Abel's past threatens to catch up with him.
