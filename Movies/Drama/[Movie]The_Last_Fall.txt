Later, things begin to look up for Kyle when he begins spending time with his former high school girlfriend Faith. Faith has a young son, and after Kyle lands a job at a nearby gym he starts to think that maybe it's time to settle down and start a family. But when a major NFL team tries to lure Kyle back onto the gridiron with an offer that's difficult to refuse and the father of Faith's child shows up seeking forgiveness for his past indiscretions, the former football star realizes he faces the most important decision he will ever make.
