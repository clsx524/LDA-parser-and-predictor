Content: Writerdirector Julie Delpy follows-up her 2007 comedy 2 Days in Paris with this tale of a happy couple who find their comfortable relationship put to the test during a tumultuous family visit. Marion (Delpy) and Mingus (Chris Rock) both come from failed relationships. But by bringing their children together, they've managed to form a small yet happy family. Tensions in their household soon begin to spike, however, when Marion's jovial father (Albert Delpy -- the director's real-life father) shows up on their doorstep with his randy daughter and her peculiar boyfriend in tow. Later, as the motor-mouthed houseguests shatter every taboo imaginable, the happy couple begin to question their commitment.
