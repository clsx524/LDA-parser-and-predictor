Content: The demented masterminds behind Hack Job and I Spill Your Guts return with this supernatural horror comedy about two hapless slackers who seek the help of a mischievous demon in sending a soul-taking behemoth back to the fiery pits of hell. Rich and Benny may not be the most eligible bachelors in town, but when a green-skinned demon named Az strolls into their lives, things soon start to look up.
