Content: Jim O'Hanlon directed this psychologically-charged family drama, starring Kristin Davis (Sex in the City), Louise Fletcher (Brainstorm) and Tammy Blanchard (Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows). Billie (Davis) seemingly has everything a woman could want, including a satisfying job, a lovely family and a beautiful home. But her life grows more complicated when dire circumstances involving her mother (Fletcher) put her schizophrenic sister, Baby (Blanchard) in her care. Billie loves Baby ardently, but it soon becomes evident that she lacks the resources to care for her properly - which forces the older sister to make some tough, emotionally demanding decisions that will change both women's lives forever.
