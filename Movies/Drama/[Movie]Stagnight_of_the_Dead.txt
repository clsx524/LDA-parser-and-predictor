Content: A typical stag weekend turns into a struggle for survival for a group of friends who find themselves pitted against an angry army of the living dead. Dean is about to get married, and his buddies are determined to send him out of the single life with a bang. Their plan: Take Dean to play Zomball - the latest craze in a post-zombie apocalypse society. Though mankind has won the war against the armies of the undead, dispatching with the walking corpses that remain above ground has proven quite a task. As a result, private companies have been forced to get creative with their clean-up methods. In Zomball, players are invited to dispatch zombies in a safe environment. When Dean and his pals break the game's number one rule, however, the zombies strike back with a vengeance. Now surrounded by flesh eaters with his best friends and a fierce stripper, Dean must aim for the head if he ever hopes to reach the altar on time.
