Content: A woman finds out the hard way that criminals have a funny way of repaying the people who've helped them in this independent comedy. Angela Masters (Elisabeth Rohm) is a talented acting coach who has discovered there isn't much market for her services outside of New York and Los Angeles. But Angela has found a lucrative market for her talents -- she offers "personality transplants" to felons awaiting trial, teaching them how to seem more sympathetic and compassionate in the witness box in order to convince the jury they deserve another chance. Angela's business is going great until she agrees to help to help coach mob kingpin Yaro Maroslav (Eric Roberts) through an upcoming trial. Angela's direction helps get Yaro off the hook, but rather than show his gratitude, he makes her one of the targets in a string of retribution killings. Also featuring Sean Patrick Flanery and Jim Holmes, The Whole Truth was the first feature film from writer and director Colleen Patrick, and received its world premiere at the 2009 Seattle International Film Festival.
