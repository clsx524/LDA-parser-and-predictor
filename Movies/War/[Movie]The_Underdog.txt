Content: In this drama, a rural family, displaced by the dust-bowl and the foreclosure of their family farm, moves to the city in search of financial security during the 1940s. The change is difficult for the impoverished clan, but it is most difficult for their son who gets picked on by the local gangs. The son tries to donate his dog Hobo to the military, but the dog is rejected.
