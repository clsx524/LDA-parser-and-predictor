Content: Earl Derr Biggers, the creator of Charlie Chan, was responsible for the international-espionage yarn Inside the Lines. The time is WWI, and the place is Gibraltar, where English girl Jane (Betty Compson) is accidentally reunited with her pre-war sweetheart, German-born Wodehouse (Ralph Forbes). Each suspects the other of being an agent for the Kaiser and the mastermind behind a plan to destroy the British fleet. Imagine their relief when they discover that they're both British intelligence agents (this is the sort of dramatic device that would later be played for laughs in such TV spoofs as Get Smart). The only true villain of the piece is a steely-eyed Hindu fanatic Amahdi, played by future character comedian Mischa Auer.
