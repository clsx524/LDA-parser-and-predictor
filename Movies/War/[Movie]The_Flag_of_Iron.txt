Content: When a loyal member of a crime syndicate volunteers to take the heat off his gang and go into temporary exile after a volatile conflict with a rival clan, the young warrior finds that his sacrifice isn't honored in this historical kung fu epic. Upon returning from his stint as a scapegoat, Iron Panther finds that his gang has joined with the enemy gang his comrades were fighting when he left.
