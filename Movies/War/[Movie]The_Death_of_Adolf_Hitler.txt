Content: Made for British television, The Death of Adolf Hitler covers ground previously explored in such films as The Last Ten Days and The Bunker. Frank Finlay stars as Hitler, a trembling shell of a man who tries to put on a brave front as his Third Reich topples all around him. Sequestered in his private Bunker in April of 1945, Hitler, his mistress Eva Braun, and his most trusted associates continue to lie to themselves that their defeat at the hands of the Allies is only temporary. Though the story is a familiar one, the film avoids the standard cliches, even expanding upon the known facts with recently unearthed historical tidbits concerning Hitler's last days on earth. The Death of Adolf Hitler is underplayed throughout, rendering the sick spectacle of Der Fuhrer's fall disturbingly realistic.
