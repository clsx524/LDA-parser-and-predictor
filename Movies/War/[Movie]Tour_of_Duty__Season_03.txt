Content: Most of the cast members present in Tour of Duty's second season, both male and female, have re-upped for season three. In charge of U.S. Army Company B stationed at Tan Son Nhut air base in the Vietnam of 1967-1968 are Lt. Myron Goldman (Stephen Caffrey) and Sgt. Zeke Anderson (Terence Knox). Also back for another hitch are platoon members Percell (Tony Becker), Ruiz (Ramon Franco), and Taylor (Miguel A. Nunez); chopper-pilot Lt. McCay (Dan Gauthier); army psychologist Jennifer Seymour (Betsy Brantley); and sexy female wire-service reporter Alex Devlin (Kim Delaney). New faces include company commander Col. Brewster (Carl Weathers), and the outspokenly antiwar medic "Doc Hock" (John Dye), and battle-weary vet "Pop" Scarlet (Lee Majors). Whereas morale had been reasonably high during the series' first two seasons, things are beginning to break down as Company B enters its third year in 'Nam. Things are particularly dismal for Cpl. Percell, who becomes addicted to morphine. Even when the troopers are demobilized and sent home, they find it difficult, if not impossible, to adjust to the civilian world. In other words, this final season of Tour of Duty is a fairly accurate representation of what was really going on in both Vietnam and America in the late '60s.
