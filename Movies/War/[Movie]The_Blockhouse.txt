Content: Set during World War 2, The Blockhouse takes place virtually in its entirety in an underground German blockhouse. Six men of wildly varying nationalities and walks of life are trapped in the blockhouse-and remain so for over six years. Though their prison is well stocked with food and beverages, the mortality rate is appalling, the victims dying more from loneliness and fear than anything else. Intriguingly, Peter Sellers is cast as a Frenchman, while French singeractor Charles Aznavour plays an Italian! The Blockhouse was based on a novel by Jean Paul Ciebert-which, incredibly, was inspired by a true story. 
Wiki info: 
The Blockhouse is a 1973 film, based on a novel by Jean-Paul Clebert. It was directed by Clive Rees and starred Peter Sellers and Charles Aznavour. It was filmed entirely in Guernsey in the Channel Islands and was entered into the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival.
On D-Day, a mixed group of forced labourers held by German forces take shelter from the bombardment inside a German bunker, but are then entombed when the entrances are blocked by shelling damage. By coincidence, the bunker is a store house and they have enough food and wine to last them for years. And they are trapped for years. The film analyzes how they deal with their underground prison, with their relationships, and with death.
