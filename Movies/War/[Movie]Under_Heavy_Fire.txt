Content: The members of Echo Company, lead by rookie captain Ramsey (Casper Van Dien), experience a disastrous tragedy when several Marines are killed by friendly fire during an assault in Vietnam. Three decades later TV documentarian Kathleen Martin (Carre Otis) brings six of the survivors back to Vietnam to confront their issues and make peace with their former enemies -- but the enemy these days is Ramsey, whom they hold to blame for the deaths of their comrades. Via flashbacks and on-the-scene battle footage, the men come to realize a painful reality, one that results in new violence in the rice patties.
