Content: You shouldn't be able to go wrong with a title like A Boy, a Girl, and a Dog, but this 51-minute cheapie comes perilously close. Jerry Hunter is the boy, Sharyn Moffett is the girl, and a dog is the Dog. The boy and girl volunteer the dog for military service. The dog becomes a hero in the K-9 corps. Oh, yes, there's a Lovable Old Gramps, in the person of Harry Davenport.
