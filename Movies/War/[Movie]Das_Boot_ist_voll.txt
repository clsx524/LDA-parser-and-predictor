Content: Based on fact, The Boat is Full is set during World War II. A group of Jewish refugees desperately attempt to escape to the safety of neutral Switzerland. The problem: too many refugees, and too little room in the boat commissioned for the trip. Director Markus Imhoof is neither a polished nor a subtle filmmaker, nor is the acting of the highest calibre. This hardly matters: the intensity and sincerity of everyone involved in The Boat is Full compensates for any and all production crudities.
