Content: A nine year old girl and her friends attempt to survive in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with zombies in order to ensure that the human race doesn't die off. Mankind has laid waste to the planet, and a mysterious virus is transforming regular people into rampaging flesh-eaters. Somehow, a few children are immune to the vicious microorganism, though the armed forces don't hesitate to kill anyone they suspect might be infected. Somehow, nine year old Camille has managed to survive following the death of her parents, though the desolate wastelands offer nothing but suffering and death for the young and weary. Eventually happening across other children like her, the group is bound together by a shared vision of the ocean. This is their destiny. If they can just survive long enough to reach the sea, perhaps Camille and her friends can summon the strength needed to rebuild society from the ashes and give hope to future generations.
