Content: A power outage at a high-security mental hospital leaves the lunatics running the asylum and the terrified kitchen staff fighting for their lives. Bandmates George (Rupert Evans), Max (Kenny Doughty), and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy) are in the midst of recording their first album. Though the money they make working in the kitchen of a psychiatric hospital helps to pay for studio time, the eerie behavior of the inmates occasionally gives the job a certain element of danger. Fortunately, a massive window between the kitchen and the dining hall keeps the trio safely separated from the patients. But the lights go out during dinner preparations one evening, and then the security system malfunctions as well. To make matters worse, the inmates are ready to take full advantage of their newfound freedom, and one of them in particular has had his eye on the kitchen staff for quite some time. Before long the situation has turned bloody, and it begins to look as if some of the staff may not survive the night.
