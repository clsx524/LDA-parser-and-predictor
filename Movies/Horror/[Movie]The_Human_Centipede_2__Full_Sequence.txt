Content: A disturbed London security guard becomes obsessed with The Human Centipede, and decides to follow in Dr. Heiter's footsteps by creating his own abomination in this self-referential sequel to the controversial horror hit. As a young boy, Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) was sexually and psychologically abused. Even though his father now languishes in prison, the damage done to him was far beyond repair. These days, Martin works the graveyard shift at a subterranean parking garage and lives at home with his loathsome mother. Meanwhile, his lonesome job affords him the perfect opportunity to indulge in his favorite pastime -- compulsively watching director Tom Six's sick horror classic The Human Centipede. And when Martin isn't watching the film, he can usually be found with his favorite scrapbook, which is bulging with Human Centipede memorabilia. Now, Martin's movie obsession is about to lead him down a frightening path of dark and deviant behavior; using Dr. Heiter's medical blueprints as his inspiration, Martin rents a warehouse and begins collecting victims to create his own version of the Human Centipede. But unlike Dr. Heiter, Martin is not an experienced surgeon and doesn't have state-of-the-art medical equipment at his disposal. Alas, Martin only has some duct tape, a staple gun, and some other basic household items. It may not be ideal, but it's enough to get the job done. And once Martin has all 12 pieces of the centipede -- including a very special one whom fans of the first film will immediately recognize -- his masterpiece will be complete.
