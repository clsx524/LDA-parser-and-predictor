Wiki info: 
Hypothermia is a 2012 American horror film written and directed by James Felix McKenney.
The project tells the story of a family (father, mother, son and son's college girlfriend) visiting their lakeside cabin in Maine. The father and son have been fishing at the same location for years, but the sudden disappearance of the local fish population puzzles the men. After initially considering the possibilities, they wonder if the lake was fished dry, or if there was a deeper, darker meaning to the empty lake. This question is quickly answered, as the family and two other fishermen are attacked by a mysterious creature living beneath the icy lake.
