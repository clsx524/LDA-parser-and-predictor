Wiki info: 
The Forgotten Ones (also known as The Tribe and After Dusk They Come) is a 2009 horrorthriller movie directed by Jorg Ihle.
A group of friends are marooned on an uncharted island after their boat crashes. They quickly become aware they are not alone, as they find themselves being killed off by a group of ancient humanoid creatures.
After completing filming, the production crew decided they had produced a movie that did not live up to the original expectations and it would not do well. They decided to remake the movie under the name "The Lost Tribe" with a new director, script and cast. However, the film is being released straight to DVD by "Voltage Pictures".
