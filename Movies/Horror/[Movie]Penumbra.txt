Content: Argentinean filmmaking duo Adrian and Ramiro Garcia Bogliano follow up their 2010 debut Cold Sweat with this slow-burning thriller concerning a ruthless businesswoman who encounters a murderous cult while attempting to rent out a dilapidated Buenos Aires apartment. Marga (Cristina Brondo) is a successful entrepreneur from Barcelona with little patience for the people of Buenos Aires. She's in the capital city to find a new tenant for her family's crumbling apartment as the locals eagerly await the solar eclipse scheduled to occur later that day. Arriving at the apartment to meet smooth-talking real-estate agent Jorge, Marga is taken aback when he claims to have a client who gladly will pay four times her advertised rental rate if the paperwork can be handled posthaste. But as the skies begin to dim, Jorge's associates begin filing into the building with an unmistakable sense of purpose. Something ominous is unfolding right before Marga's eyes, and by the time the moon moves into position, a shocking ceremony signals a coming darkness that could consume the entire world.
