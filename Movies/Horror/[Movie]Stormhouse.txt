Content: An attempt to communicate with a supernatural entity at a top secret underground military base goes terribly awry in director Dan Turner's found footage-style horror film. In the run up 2003 invasion of Iraq, the military captures an apparition, and locks it up in Stormhouse - a clandestine base far below earth's surface. In order to communicate with the entity, the big brass brings in a spiritual medium. But when the specter escapes, no one on the base is safe from its wrath. 
Wiki info: 
Stormhouse is a 2011 British independent horror film.
Four months before the war in Iraq, a supernatural creature is caught by the United States army and locked in British military facility. Hayley (Katie Flynn) comes into the facility as a paranormal investigator. She is called in to see if the entity is safely locked away. As the film continues, the entity is released and starts killing people in the facility off.
Paul Doro of Shock Till You Drop said that "Stormhouse is an example of boring mediocrity". Ross Miller of Blogcritics called the film "one of the biggest disappointments of the EIFF 2011". Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict thought that the film "seemed like such a cool idea. Instead, we getâ€¦a chain link fence."
