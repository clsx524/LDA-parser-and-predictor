Content: A filmmaker and his crew get more than they bargained for in this low-budget haunted house film directed by Paul Harrison. Director Eric Hartman (John Ireland) chooses the old Beal mansion for the setting to his latest horror outing, taking little heed of the house's eerie past. As shooting commences, Hartman demands his leading lady, Gayle (Faith Domergue), recite passages from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. However, by doing so, the tormented spirits of the Beal family that had been trapped in the mansion are set free and begin restaging the grisly deaths that met the doomed family several years ago. As various crew members turn up dead, the remaining filmmakers desperately attempt to escape the house's evil spirits, while also trying to piece together the secrets of the house.
