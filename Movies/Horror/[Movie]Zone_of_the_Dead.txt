Wiki info: 
Zone of the Dead, also known as Apocalypse of the Dead (Zona Mrtvih in Serbian) is a 2009 Serbian horror film by directors Milan Konjević and Milan Todorović. It stars Ken Foree, most well known for his starring role in Dawn of the Dead in 1978.
The film starts off with a police-escorted prisoner, who is being transported under the supervision of Interpol. The route leads them through the city of Pančevo, where they encounter an ecological holocaust and the people infected by the biohazard, who are trying to kill them. Two Interpol agents, Mortimer Reyes and Mina Milius, soon realize that their only chance for escape from the zombie hordes lies in allying with the dangerous, mysterious prisoner.
