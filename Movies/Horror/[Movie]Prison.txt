Content: Prison guard Ethan Sharpe (Lane Smith) watched as Burke (Viggo Mortensen) dies in the electric chair in 1964. Over two decades later, Sharpe is the warden, and Burke returns from the dead to exact revenge on the wicked warden when the prison re-opens. Two victims drip blood while dangling in barbed wire in a macabre dance of death, and the guards and inmates suffer at the hands of the malevolent Burke as he seeks his supernatural vengeance. The film location was the Wyoming State Prison. Built at the turn of the century, the jail became a tourist attraction in 1981. 
Wiki info: 
Prison is a 1988 horror film starring Viggo Mortensen. It was filmed at the Old State Prison in Rawlins, Wyoming with many of its residents on the cast and crew.
In 1956, inmate Charlie Forsythe swallowed 60,000 volts of electricity for a murder he did not commit.
When Creedmore Prison is reopened after thirty years, it has not been standing empty. Charlie Forsythe is back - still charged with electric heat. Waiting for Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith) - the man who stood by as Forsythe rode the electric chair.
Forsythe quickly makes up for lost time as his vengeance rises to a fever pitch of violent fury. Burke (Viggo Mortensen) and the other inmates soon realize that they will all be slaughtered unless Forsythe is allowed to repay his long-standing debt. With the lives of Creedmore in the balance, Sharpe and Forsythe are finally brought face-to-rotting-face in a duel that will pit Forsythe's supernatural rage against Sharpe's bloodthirsty instinct for survival.
