Content: A Detroit 20-something incurs the wrath of a ruthless serial killer after attempting to buy a beat-up van used in a series of grisly murders. Campbell Jackson is flat broke, and in desperate need of a car when his spots a van that could get him back on the road, and out of his dead-end job at a local car wash. If Campbell only knew that the owner of the booby-trapped van uses it as his personal killing chamber, he would have never inquired about it in the first place. But now the maniac has his number, and the only way for Campbell to save himself and his girlfriend from becoming his next victims is to seek the help of a shady conman who's just as dangerous as the motor-psycho with his foot on the gas and murder on his mind.
