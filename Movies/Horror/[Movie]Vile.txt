Content: Recalling Saw, Hostel and other similar efforts, this direct-to-video horror picture concerns a group of strangers imprisoned in a house. A video begins to play, and informs them that they may escape, but must engage in sadistic and masochistic games of torture and suffering in order to do so. The crowd soon breaks into schisms, marred by secret pacts, betrayals, and horrific violence.
