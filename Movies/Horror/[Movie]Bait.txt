Content: Supermarket shoppers battle man-eating sharks when a tsunami plunges a coastal resort under water, and the perfect predator gets a whole new stalking ground. Queensland, Australia: The weather is perfect, the water is blue, and the vacationers at a luxury resort file into an underground supermarket to stock up for another day in paradise. Just then, an armed madman bursts in with an itchy trigger finger and a desperate gleam in his eye. Little do the frightened hostages realize, he will soon be the least of their worries; the waters around Queensland are rising fast, and before long the store will be completely submerged. When that happens, the aisles will be filled with hungry tiger sharks in search of a fresh meal. Now, in order to avoid becoming the Catch of the Day, the desperate shoppers must band together, and show the sharks who's really at the top of the food chain.
