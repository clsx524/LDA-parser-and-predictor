Content: A weekend getaway descends into a paranoid fight for survival when a group of vacationers uncover a serial killer in their midst. Mandy (Gemma Harvey) met Tristan (Gordon Alexander) during a one night stand. Smitten, she invites him to join her herself, her brother Calvin (Rhys Meredith), and his girlfriend Paige (Sophie Linfield) for a relaxing getaway at a secluded cabin. And for Tristan, the timing couldn't be better; he's desperate to escape the city, and there's something he's not sharing with his fellow travelers. Meanwhile, a local policeman tells the group to be wary of strangers, because a maniac known as the Tree Surgeon has been butchering people in the forest, and decorating the trees with their severed limbs. Later that very night, a desperate man named Shawn comes knocking on their cabin door. He's just survived a brutal attack, but thanks to emergency room nurse Paige it looks as if he'll pull through. Meanwhile, paranoia takes hold when it becomes apparent that the Tree Surgeon lurks among them. And by the time his true identity is revealed, there may be no one left to tell his secret.
