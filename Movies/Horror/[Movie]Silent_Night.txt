Content: Silent Night, Deadly Night gets the remake treatment with this Anchor Bay release starring Jaime King as a young deputy who's on the hunt for a killer dressed as Santa Claus. With the help of her quirky sheriff (Malcolm McDowell) and her father (John B. Lowe), a retired cop-turned-Santa portrayer, the fresh-faced officer stalks the streets of her small Midwestern town as its citizens prepare for the annual Christmas Eve parade -- unaware that a maniac is on the hunt for naughty festivalgoers. Steven C. Miller directs from a script by Jayson Rothwell. 
Wiki info:

A small-town sheriff and deputy are on the hunt for a murderous Santa Claus terrorizing their community on Christmas Eve. But with the streets full of Santas for the annual Christmas parade, the killer is hiding in plain sight. He has made his list, checked it twice, and the naughty are going to pay with their lives.
