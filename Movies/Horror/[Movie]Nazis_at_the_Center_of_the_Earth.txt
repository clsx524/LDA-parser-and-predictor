Wiki info: 
Nazis at the Center of the Earth is a direct-to-video horror sci-fi action film produced by The Asylum that stars Dominique Swain and Jake Busey. It was released on 24 April 2012 on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The UK release was called Bloodstorm.
The film is similar to the popular PC game Wolfenstein 3D which shares the same story and characters of Nazi zombies set to take over the world. The film goes so far as to have Robot Hitler, the same enemy found at the end of Wolfenstein 3D. The story also shares similarities with the film Iron Sky.
A group of researchers in Antarctica are abducted by a platoon of gas-masked soldiers wearing swastika arm bands and dragged into a hidden environment in the center of the Earth. There, they discover that Dr. Josef Mengele and group of surviving Nazi soldiers are plotting an invasion of Earth to create a Fourth Reich.
