Content: When a killer emulating Jack the Ripper begins to haunt contemporary London's East End, two mismatched detectives enlist the aid of a noted "Ripperologist" in halting a vicious murder spree. DI Chandler and DS Miles may both take drastically different approaches to their job, but their common goal remains the same - stop the killer from claiming any more lives. Fortunately for them, Edward Buchan has studied the original Jack the Ripper case inside and out, and he's convinced that history will provide the clues needed to crack this difficult case.
