Content: A convicted pedophile escapes from jail and embarks on a vicious murder spree, killing the jury-members who sentenced him to a lifetime behind bars and collecting their faces as gruesome trophies. When Leonard Karlsson, Jr. arrived in his new home of concrete and steel, his fellow inmates beat him so badly that his face was horribly disfigured. No one ever suspected that Karlsson could ever walk free again, but now he's back on the outside, and looking for revenge. Upon returning to the town where his trial was held, Karlsson delivers a death sentence to the twelve men and women who previously sealed his fate. Local waitress Claire Norris (Emily Hardy) was on that jury, and she's determined not to wind up on Karlsson's growing list of victims.
