American Warships is an science fiction action film by The Asylum, that was released direct-to-video on May 15, 2012. In the tradition of The Asylum's film catalog, the film is a mockbuster of the HasbroUniversal Pictures film Battleship.
Originally the film was titled American Battleship, but Universal later involved The Asylum in a copyright lawsuit over the film due to its resemblance to their film. As a result of the controversy, the name of the film was changed to American Warships.
When an alien force wages war on Earth, only the crew of the USS Iowa, the last American battleship, stands in their way.
