Content: Beast Cops director Dante Lam continues to keep Hong Kong action cinema alive and kicking with this dark yet vibrant thriller following an unlikely pair of policemen who uncover evidence of widespread corruption while investigating the murder of a local prostitute. Determined to catch the killer, rogue patrolman Manfred (Leon Lai) is joined by cagey Narcotics Bureau cop Kee (Richie Jen) in singling out a suspect. As the clues begin to add up, the two detectives follow them straight into a shady arms deal that explodes into violence. When the smoke clears on the high profile shootout, numerous civilians are dead and public outcry over the use of excessive force by the police reaches an all time high. Unfortunately for the two dedicated cops, things are about to get much worse, because when they later uncover DNA evidence that implicates decorated Hong Kong policeman Cheung-On (Liu Kai-Chi) in the killing, a Pandora's Box of corruption opens up that threatens to destroy Manfred's reputation, and end his career.
