Wiki info: 
Kill Speed is a 2010 direct-to-video action film directed by Kim Bass, starring Andrew Keegan, Brandon Quinn, Nick Carter, Natalia Cigliuti and Greg Grunberg.
The film is set in the scorched desert of Southern California and Keegan, Quinn, Natalia Cigliuti, Nick Carter, Reno Wilson, Christian Monzon and Greg Grunberg play characters involved in a high-octane “TOP GUN” meets “FAST & FURIOUS” type tale about best friends who fly super fast, high-tech, experimental airplanes to deliver Mexican manufactured crystal meth throughout California in order to fund their Hollywood, rock-star lifestyle. But when a beautiful young woman, who is not what she pretends to be, infiltrates their group it sends their world and illicit operation into a tailspin.
The film, which incorporates incredible, never-been-done-before, air-to-air filming of actual airplanes (including 300&#160;mph propeller driven, experimental race planes and military fighter jets) with all the actors actually in the airplanes and, in some cases, at the controls while delivering dialogue.
