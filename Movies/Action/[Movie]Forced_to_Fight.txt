Content: A retired underground fighting champion returns to the ring to save his younger brother from a vicious crime boss. Shane Slavin (Gary Daniels) used to be one of the toughest fighters around. But those days are over, because now all Shane wants is to settle down and start a family. When his little brother incurs the wrath of an underworld heavy (Peter Weller) with a fierce reputation, however, Shane agrees to settle his sibling's debts in the arena.
