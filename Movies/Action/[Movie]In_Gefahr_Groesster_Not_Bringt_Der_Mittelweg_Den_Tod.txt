Content: In Extreme Blows of Fate the Just Milieu Bring Death mingles real documentary footage covering contemporary (1975) German politics with a spoof of spy stories. The stories include: a woman prostitute who gets even with men by stealing their wallets and cars, and a female Marxist spy who is so boring to her handler that she gets fired. The Miss Germany beauty pageant is one of the settings in which these stories take place.
