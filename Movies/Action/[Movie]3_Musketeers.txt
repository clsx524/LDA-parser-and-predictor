Wiki info: 
3 Musketeers is a direct-to-video action film by The Asylum loosely based on The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. The film is directed by Cole McKay and is a mockbuster intending to "cash-in" on the Paul W. S. Anderson film The Three Musketeers. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on October 25, 2011.
Unlike other adaptations of The Three Musketeers, this film is a modern take on the original story.
Set in the near-future USA, when junior NSA officer Alexandra D'Artagnan uncovers a plot by a corrupt general to assassinate the President of the United States to instigate a coup to take over the government in order to install a militarist regime, she enlists the help of three infamous international spies to stop the threat.
