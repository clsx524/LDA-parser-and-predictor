Cheung (Shawn Yue) is part of the Stealth Drivers, a clandestine Hong Kong police unit comprised of the department's best drivers. Years ago, Cheung's mentor Lo (Anthony Wong) was nearly killed chasing elusive getaway driver Sun (Guo Xiaodong). In the wake of that fateful pursuit, Lo gave up life in the fast lane. But when Sun boldly springs his criminal cohort Huang Zhong (Li Haitao) from jail, Cheung implores Lo to pass on his legendary driving skills. Later, when Sun and Huang execute a daring jewel heist, ambitious rookie Cheung uses his newfound skills to beat them at their own game.
