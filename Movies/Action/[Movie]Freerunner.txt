Content: A group of freerunners race for their lives after being outfitted with explosive collars, and given 90 minutes to reach the other side of town or die trying. Ryan (Sean Faris) and his fellow parkour enthusiasts are used to taking big risks, and they make big money pushing the boundaries of physical endurance. But when Mr. Frank (Danny Dyer) enters the picture, Ryan's favorite pastime turns deadly serious. Mr. Frank and his friends are gamblers with no regard for human life, and their latest bet is which of the runners can navigate their urban jungle the fastest. With ticking time bombs strapped around their necks, the runners must find their way across the city in less than 90 minutes. The winner will receive a cool $1 million, and everyone else will get a splitting headache. When Ryan learns that his girlfriend has been kidnapped as well, he quickly realizes that he's got his work cut out for him.
