Content: Pay a visit to an Appalachian farm where skateboarding is the religion, and shepherd Brewce Martin leads an anarchic flock of adrenaline-addicted adolescents in their tireless quest for the ultimate rush. In Skatopia, the rules of society don't apply. Here, amidst a sprawling paradise of concrete and mountains, skateboard sessions stretch into the small hours of the morning, and insanity is the law of the land. "Dictator Brewce" stands proudly at the center of this wild circus, but when his backwoods utopia faces an uncertain future, he must call on his congregation to help keep the demented dream alive.
