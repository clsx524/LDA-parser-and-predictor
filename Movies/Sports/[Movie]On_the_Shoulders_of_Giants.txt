Content: This documentary, co-written by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, tells the story of a black professional basketball team known as the New York Renaissance Big Five, shortened to the New York City Rens by all who knew and loved them. Decades before the civil rights movement, this squad overcame racism and financial troubles to become the first black team to capture a national title in their sport. Although society kept them from competing officially against professional white teams for an extended period of time, they did manage to arrange a famous exhibition match against the recognized national powerhouse of that era. The filmmakers use archival footage, interviews with historians, and reenactments in order to share this inspiring sociological and sports story.
