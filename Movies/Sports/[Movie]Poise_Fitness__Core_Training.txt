Content: As developed by Dr. Teri Jory, the 'Poise' fitness program sets the same basic goal for each participant as traditional Pilates - the strengthening of one's core muscles - but enhances the approach by adding elements of dance and martial arts to help the participant achieve maximum physical and mental fitness. Jory hosts the exercise release  Poise Fitness: Core Training, with a routine that begins by strengthening the participant's pelvic and abdominal muscles and then spreads outward to firm and sculpt the exerciser's hip, legs, buns and abdominal muscles.
