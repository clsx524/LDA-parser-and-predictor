Content: Long before television and video games gave New York City kids the option of disappearing into alternate worlds for hours on end, the best option for passing the time and burning off energy was to hit the street for a game of stickball. In this documentary, narrator Hector Elizondo takes viewers back to a time when the city streets echoed with the sounds of laughing children, and games like Punchball, Skully, and Jonny on a Pony helped instill youngsters and their parents with a very real sense of community. In addition to offering a nostalgic glimpse into a bygone era, New York Street Games also explores the potential reasons urban adolescents no longer partake in the simple joys of games like Stick Ball, as well as the potential effects that today's more introverted forms of entertainment may be having on both their behavior, and our shifting social structures. 
Wiki info: 
New York Street Games is a 2010 documentary film directed by Matt Levy about children's games played by kids in New York City for centuries. The games are fondly remembered by people who grew up in the city. Current and historical documentary footage shows children playing these games. The story is brought to the present with discussions of the current role of street games and opinions as to what kids lose by not having the freedom to play without adult supervision, most importantly the social skills developed when kids could play in the streets.
New York Street Games lovingly recalls a central feature of the lives of hundreds of thousands of children who grew up in New York City in the twentieth century: games played in the streets of the city.
Many of the ball games featured are most often played with a pink rubber ball called a Spaldeen. Anybody who grew up playing these games can be transported back to their childhood just by smelling a Spaldeen.
