Content: The loggerhead turtle has one of the longest and most difficult migratory patterns of any aquatic animal; sea turtles newly hatched on the East Coast of the United States (usually in Florida) make their way from the sand into the ocean, and then begin a voyage that spans the entire Atlantic Ocean, only to return from whence they came. Filmmaker Nick Stringer follows the loggerhead turtle on a adventure of more than 9,000 miles with only instinct as their guide in the documentary Turtle: The Incredible Journey. Stringer and his camera crew spent two years following loggerhead turtles on their trip across the ocean, and have captured on film the remarkable life cycle of a beautiful but endangered creature that struggles to survive in an increasingly unforgiving environment. Turtle: The Incredible Journey was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.

Turtle: The Incredible Journey is a 2009 documentary film narrated by Miranda Richardson and directed by Nick Stringer. The film was co-produced by SeaWorld Pictures and Tradewind Pictures, and distributed in the United States by Hannover House.
A female loggerhead turtle follows the path of her ancestors on one of the most extraordinary journeys in the natural world. From a beach in Florida, she rides the Gulf Stream to the frozen north, swimming around the entire North Atlantic to Africa and then back to the beach where she was born. But her chance of survival is low. Each season, two million loggerhead turtles are hatched but just one in ten thousand turtles will return safely to lay their eggs.
