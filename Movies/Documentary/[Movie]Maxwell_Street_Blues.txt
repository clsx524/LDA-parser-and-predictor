Content: Maxwell Street Blues is a documentary on a section of south Chicago known for its street musicians. Directors Linda Williams and Raul Zaritsky conduct interviews with performers like the blind Arvella Gray, while the customary crowds collect around favorite spots -- and do a little shopping in-between sets. In an off-beat opening scene, a bus driver expansively quotes the Bible to his passengers -- this and other unique touches give the viewer a good sense of the spirit and flavor of life and the "blues" on Maxwell Street.
