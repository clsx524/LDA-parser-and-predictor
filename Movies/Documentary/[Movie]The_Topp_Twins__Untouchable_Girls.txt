Content: The Topp Twins are one of New Zealand's leading comedy acts, and one of the more unusual entertainment phenomena to come from the Southern Hemisphere. Lynda Topp and Jools Topp are sisters who are known as gifted singers, performing country-flavored material with superb harmonies, and also as hilarious comedians who portray a number of offbeat characters, including a pair of beer-swilling farmers, two Ã¼ber-refined society ladies, and the Camp Leader and Camp Follower. While the Topp Twins have a thoroughly mainstream audience at home, Lynda and Jools might be considered too radical for mass consumption in many countries -- both sisters are out-of-the-closet lesbians who are outspoken activists for gay rights, environmental issues, and racial equality. Filmmaker Leanne Pooley offers a look into the public and private lives of this talented duo in The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls, in which the sisters, their family, and their friends talk about their upbringing, the support they received from their parents, their career, their activism, and how they dealt with a serious health scare that hit one of the sisters. The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received the People's Choice Award.
