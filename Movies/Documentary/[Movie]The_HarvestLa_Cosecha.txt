Content: Documentary filmmaker U. Roberto Romano shines an illuminating light on the plight of itinerant underage migrant workers in America, who work grueling hours to feed their families yet aren't protected by child labor laws. Shot during the 2009 harvest season, the film profiles 12-year-old Zulema Lopez, 14-year-old Perla Sanchez, and 16-year-old Victor Huapilla -- each of whom regularly labor for 14 hours a day, seven days a week, to pick the produce that feeds America. Unable to achieve any real sense of stability as their families move from town to town in search of work, some of the youths give up on their dreams early on as others strive for the day they can get an education, and advocate for other manual laborers who lack the voice or political clout to make a real change.
