Content: Filmmakers Tyler Measom and Jennilyn Merten profile a group of teenage boys who were banished from the polygamous Utah community founded by controversial spiritual leader Warren Jeffs for the sin of daring to question his God-like authority. In these communities, girls are considered precious gems, and boys are exiled the moment they display the first signs of individual thought. By following the journey of a group of boys who must navigate the real world after being purposefully raised to be ignorant, we get a vivid picture the power that Jeffs wields over his followers, and daily struggles faced by teens who can't go back to their families, even if they want to.
