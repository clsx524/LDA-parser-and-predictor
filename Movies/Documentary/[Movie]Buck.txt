Content: This documentary tells the incredible true story of Buck Brannaman, the unusually perceptive cowboy whose remarkable ability to communicate with horses inspired both Nicholas Evans' novel The Horse Whisperer and the hit Robert Redford film that followed. As a young boy, Brannaman developed a love for the cowboy lifestyle by performing lasso tricks. But one false move meant a merciless beating at the hands of his abusive father, and as a result Brannaman gradually developed the intuition to recognize when horses were in distress. In Buck we not only learn about Brannaman's remarkable life, but also watch as he works closely with horses and their owners to encourage greater communication.
