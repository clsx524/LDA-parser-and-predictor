Content: In the heart of one of Buenos Aires' most exclusive neighborhoods, you will find La Recoleta Cemetery, arguably the most prestigious graveyard in Argentina. La Recoleta is the final home for many of the country's most important historical figures -- founders of the nation, high-ranking politicians, artists, authors and the wealthy and influential. However, a handful of noted rebels and dissidents are also interned there, and one can trace much of the nation's history by noting the names of the headstones. Filmmaker Nicolas Prividera presents an impressionistic look into Argentina's past and present in the film Tierra de los Padres (aka Fatherland), in which actors stroll through La Recoleta Cemetery, observing the graves of some of the nation's heroes and villains, and reading aloud from their writings. Taken together, the speeches form a story of political turmoil and strife, as the film also offers a glimpse into the work of the men who maintain this historic site. Fatherland received its North American premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.
