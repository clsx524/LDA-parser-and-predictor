Content: This Canadian documentary is a moving study of the ravaging forces of disease and the healing powers of friendship. Directed by Philip Lyall and Nimisha Mukerji, the film follows 23-year-old Eva as she waits for a double-lung transplant that will ease her cystic fibrosis. Helping her cope with the emotional and physical tolls of the disease are two fellow patients she knows only through the Internet: 22-year-old Kina, who is dealing with the aftermath of her own lung transplant, and 19-year-old Meg, whose situation is complicated by inadequate access to healthcare.
