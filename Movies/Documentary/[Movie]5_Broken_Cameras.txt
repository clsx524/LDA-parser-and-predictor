Content: A Palestinian farmer who purchased a video camera to document the birth of his fourth son begins using it to record the struggle between his people and Israeli settlers, and continues to buy a new camera each time his old one is damaged in the fray. The year was 2005. Bil'in family man Emad Burnat was celebrating the birth of his fourth son Gibreel when the settlers began erecting a massive separation barrier in their village. Over the course of the next two years, Burnat alternated between documenting his son's development, and turning his camera on the peaceful protests over the controversial barrier. As the tensions swell, Burnat finds himself having to replace broken cameras with alarming frequency. This is the story of each of Burnat's cameras, and the images they captured as his friends, family, and loved ones waged a valiant struggle to preserve their way of life.
