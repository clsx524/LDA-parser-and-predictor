Content: It's often said that artists are their own worst critics, and in this independent study of legendary rockers Led Zeppelin, candid interviews with Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Bonham, and John Paul Jones filmed during the height of the band's career strip away the media sensationalism to paint an honest and intimate portrait of the outfit behind such hits as "Stairway to Heaven" and "Misty Mountain Hop". Compiled with complete editorial freedom and featuring firsthand accounts of life with Led Zeppelin by publicist BP Fallon and bodyguard Michael Francis, this release also offers extensive notes by rock journalist Steven Rosen, who accompanied the band on their 1977 U.S. tour.
