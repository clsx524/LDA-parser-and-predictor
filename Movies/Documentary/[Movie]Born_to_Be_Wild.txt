Released Year: 2011

Director: David Lickley
Cast: 
Content: Shot in IMAX 3D, David Lickley's 40-minute documentary Born to Be Wild observes various orphaned jungle animals and their day-to-day behavioral interactions with the individuals who rescue them and raise them to adulthood. The film unfurls in two separate geographic spheres. Half of it takes place in the rain forests of Borneo, where celebrated primatologist Dr. Birute Galdikas assists baby orangutans; the other half takes place on the arid savannahs of Kenya, where zoologist Dame Daphne Sheldrick works with baby elephant calves. The goal, in each case, is not simply rehabilitation but the ultimate return of these animals to the wild, where (it is hoped) they will function freely and independently. Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman narrates; Drew Fellman produced and authored the script.
