Content: Documentary filmmaker Jeff Prosserman reveals the astounding true-life story of Harry Markopolos, the former Boston securities analyst who dedicated his life to exposing Bernie Madoff's calamitous Ponzi scheme before the entire world. It was back in 1999 when Prosserman first caught wind of the massive white-collar corruption being perpetrated by NASDAQ chairman Madoff and his powerful cabal of moneymen. The further Prosserman's investigation went, the more he sensed that his life could be in great danger. Only by assembling a team of dedicated and passionate investigators would the reluctant vigilante succeed in ensuring that Madoff paid for his crimes. But it was a daunting task indeed, and it would be an entire decade before justice was served. From the initial shocking discovery to the final verdict, this is the story that the mainstream press failed to tell.
