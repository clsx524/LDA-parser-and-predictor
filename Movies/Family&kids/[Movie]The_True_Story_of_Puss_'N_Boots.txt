Content: For generations, children around the world have enjoyed the classic fairy tale of Puss 'n' Boots (or, in France, Le Chat botte), the endlessly clever granary cat who uses a wealth of clever ploys (and a magic spell or two) to help his master gain fame, riches and true love with a princess. The story receives a new interpretation in this French-language animated feature from co-directors Jerome Deschamps, Pascal Herold and Macha Makeïeff, with vocal work by Deschamps as the lead feline (William Shatner voices the English version), Yolande Moreau as The Queen, Louise Wallon as The Princess, and Jean-Claude Bolle-Reddat as Chambellan, the cat's master.
