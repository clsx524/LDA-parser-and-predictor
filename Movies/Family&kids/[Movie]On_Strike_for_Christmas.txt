Content: When the demands of Christmas become too much to handle, one suburban mother responds by going on strike, and inspires the other overburdened mothers in her small community to follow suit. Joy Robertson (Daphne Zuniga) is the kind of mom who likes to make the Christmas season special. But this year, something is different. Joy has started to feel as if her family simply expects her to drop everything to cook, buy presents, and decorate the house. When Joy responds by calling a halt to the familiar Christmas traditions, she is quickly joined by the rest of the mothers in her neighborhood. Now the more steam Joy's movement gains, the faster her once quiet town spirals into complete chaos.
