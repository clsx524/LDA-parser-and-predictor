One night a UFO Appears on the planet Earth and drops a green goo substance into a large pumpkin field (apparently they were flushing their toilet). Farmer Jeb, the owner of the patch, comes outside to investigate but is taken by something offscreen. Susan and the fellow monsters go back to Susan's home in Modesto, California, just in time for Halloween celebrations. Susan spends time with her parents, while the other monsters join in trick-or-treating, collecting a large amount of candy. Later, it is revealed that the monsters came to destroy mutant pumpkins disguised as Jack-o-lanterns. When the pumpkins begin to eat children's candies to grow larger, Susan fights the pumpkins with regenerating abilities, the monsters and children defeat them by throwing excessive candies to bloat them up and explode them while Susan punch its head, allowing one of the pumpkins to escape until she whistles for Butteryflyosaurus (dressed as Elvis) to destroy it while Missing Link scared the other surviving pumpkin for it to explode. But, in a twist ending, some of the pumpkin "blood" (the green goo) falls into a planting of carrots, causing a mutant carrot to be formed.
