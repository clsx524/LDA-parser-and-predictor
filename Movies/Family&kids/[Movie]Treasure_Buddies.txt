Content: Everyone's favorite canine film series continues with this installment following five chatty pups as they venture to Egypt in search of a mythical jewel that was once the treasure of Cleocatra's collection. Upon learning that the famed Cat's Eye jewel is hidden somewhere in Egypt, Rosebud, Budderball, B-Dawg, Mudbud, and Buddha set out on the adventure of a lifetime. But they're not the only ones racing to procure the Cat's Eye, because a treacherous feline named Ubasti seeks to harness the gemstone's power to gain the ultimate advantage in the eternal war between cats and dogs. Perhaps with a little help from a friendly camel named Cammy and an artful orangutan named Babi, our four-legged heroes can track down the Cat's Eye first, and prevent a true catastrophe from disturbing the balance in the animal kingdom.
