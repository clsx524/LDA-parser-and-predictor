Wiki info: 
Super K (also known as Kiara the Brave) is a 2011 animated film written by Vibha Singh and Jaspinder S. Kang and directed by Smita Maroo and Vijay S. Bhanushali. The film is produced by Smita Maroo. It was released by Shemaroo Entertainment. 
Dreamzone is a special world in the Galaxy, ruled by the kindhearted King Maximus. Unknown to him, his brother Badmess is plotting to overthrow him. Badmess creates Super K, a boy superhero, using the powers of all the Dreamzonians. But a goof-up causes Super K to turn out a freak, unable to control his powers, and he is deserted by Badmess. Badmess befriends the evil Dr. Ozox, who has his own sinister plan to take over Dreamzone.
Super K and his friends come together to protect Dreamzone from the evil clutches of Dr. Ozox, but at the same time Super K has to learn to control his powers.
The film was released on Yahoo! Movieplex, a feature of the Yahoo! India web site, as an exclusively online animated feature film.
In 2012, it was released directly to video in the United States as Kiara the Brave, with cover art showing only an incidental female character with red hair. This was considered by many to be an obvious attempt to remind consumers of the female, red-headed protagonist of Brave, a DisneyPixar movie set in medieval Scotland.
