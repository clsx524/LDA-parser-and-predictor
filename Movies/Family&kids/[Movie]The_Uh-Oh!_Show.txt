Content: A reporter investigates a gruesome television game show where contestants literally get rich or die trying in this gore-drenched horror satire from legendary director H.G. Lewis. Fred Finagler is the creator of "The Uh Oh Show." While a few lucky contestants walk away with big money, most don't walk away at all since their legs have been viciously torn from their sockets. Meanwhile, journalist Jill Burton is determined to find out if the hit show is for real, or some kind of elaborate ruse. When Fred ups the ghastly ante with another, even more disgusting show that taps into viewers' collective fear of Grimm's Fairy Tales, it quickly becomes apparent that he's not just in it for the fame.
