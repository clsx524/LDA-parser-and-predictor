Nana
Released Year: 1955
Running time: 117
Director: Christian-Jaque
Cast: 
Content: The most frequently filmed of Emile Zola's works, Nana was given a slick, polished cinemazation by French- filmmaker Christian-Jacque in 1955. Martine Carol is well (if predictably) cast in the title role, playing a poverty-stricken Parisian girl who rises to prominence as a high-priced whore. Nana is content to love 'em and leave 'em until she becomes the mistress of government-official Charles Boyer. Her genuine love for Boyer results in disgrace and disaster for them both. While less inhibited than the bowdlerized 1934 Sam Goldwyn production of Nana, this FrenchItalian co-production is rather far afield from the Zola original.
