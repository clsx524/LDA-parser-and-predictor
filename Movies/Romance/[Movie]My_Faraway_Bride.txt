Content: Indian director Rajeev Manoj Virani's cross-cultural romance My Bollywood Bride follows the love affair that unexpectedly blossoms between a hunky, fair-haired American novelist named Alex (Jason Lewis) and an ebullient Indian tour guide named Reena (Kashmera Shah). The two fall in love in Los Angeles, but are then forcibly separated by circumstance, as Reena must return to Asia to tend to her seriously ill father and enter an arranged marriage with a cocky, egomaniacal producer named Shekhar (Gulshan Grover). Failing to understand (or accept) these circumstances, Alex then flies to India, heart-in-tow, determined to win Reena back - and immediately runs head-first into madcap conflicts with both Shekhar and Reena's parents. Sanjay Suri co-stars as Reena's Indian pal Bobby, who makes a series of unsuccessful attempts to keep Alex out of trouble as the American vies for Reena's heart. Shah, Brad Listermann and Richard Martini co-authored the script.
