Content: A teenage girl sets out on a cross country trip to visit her uncle in the Midwest, discovering that she has what it takes to be a true competitor after she's tricked into participating in a local horse race. All Lindsey knows about her Uncle Jack is that he lives on a ranch, and he's haunted by a past tragedy he never speaks of. Upon arriving at the ranch, Lindsey reconnects with her uncle and falls for handsome ranch hand Logan. But her greatest challenge is yet to come, because despite the fact that Lindsey has virtually no riding experience, she's hoodwinked into racing spoiled rotten Abigail at the upcoming county fair. Sometimes the trips we least want to take are the ones that can teach us the most about who we really are.
