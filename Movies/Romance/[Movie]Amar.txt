Wiki info: 
Amar is a 1954 black-and-white Hindi movie. Produced and directed by Mehboob Khan, the film stars Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, Nimmi and Jayant. Amar features music by Naushad with lyrics by Shakeel Badayuni.
A delicately nuanced psychological drama, exploring a 3-way relationship between the main characters and the crisis of conscience that rocks it. A prosperous, well-respected lawyer, in love with and engaged to an educated, socially-conscious young woman, succumbs to a weak moment and rapes a poor local village milkmaid. The rest of the story deals with the aftermath of this tragic event, with all the inevitable undercurrents of guilt, penitence and pervasive heartbreak that stem from it.
