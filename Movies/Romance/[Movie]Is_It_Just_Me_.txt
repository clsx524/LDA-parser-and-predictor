Content: A case of mistaken identity leads to a rivalry that humorously ponders the issue of mind vs. body in this gay-themed romantic comedy. Blaine (Nicholas Downs) is a talented young writer whose career is on the rise. Blaine has just moved to Los Angeles, and while he's good looking, in a city full of Grade A hunks he feels a bit inadequate, and the fact he's looking for a serious relationship rather than a quick hook-up is making things all the more difficult. While browsing an internet chat room, Blaine crosses virtual paths with Xander (David Loren), a handsome young musician, and after a phone call Blaine thinks he's finally found the perfect man. However, Blaine soon realizes that while Xander was talking to him on the phone, the picture he saw online was Blaine's very buff flatmate Cameron (Adam Huss). Not wanting to disappoint Xander, Blaine persuades Cameron to go on a date pretending to be him, but while Blaine is a romantic and a deep thinker, Cameron likes partying and one night stands. Can Cameron persuade Xander he's Blaine? Does he really want to? And is Xander really looking for sex or substance? Is It Just Me? received its world premiere at the 2010 San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival.
