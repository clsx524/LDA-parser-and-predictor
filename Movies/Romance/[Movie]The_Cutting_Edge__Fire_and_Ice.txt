Content: A figure skater turns to teaching after her partner suffers a debilitating injury, and later summons the courage to get back out on the ice by teaming with a rebellious speed-skater with a bad reputation. Alexandria "Alex" Delgado (Francia Raisa) and her skating partner were absolutely inseparable - both on and off of the ice. So when he gets injured, she decides to take a break from skating. Meanwhile, as Alex turns to teaching as a means of making ends meet, James Van Behr (Berndan Fehr) gets banned from speed skating, and decides she would be the perfect figure skating partner. Though their skills on the ice prove a perfect match, their constant bickering off the ice makes a future as a skating duo look unlikely at best. Now, with the gold in reach once again, Alex attempts struggles to stay focused on winning as their growing mutual attraction begins to thaw her icy cold demeanor.
