Content: John Nelson (Hobart Bosworth) is a cruel sea captain who has harbored a grudge against humankind ever since his wife deserted him 16 years ago. When Tom Walton (Emory Johnson) is cast aside by his family for his debaucherous behavior, he takes a job as a deck hand on Nelson's whaling ship. The crew tries to mutiny when the water supply goes low, and Nelson single-handedly beats up the surly sailors. Tom is sent ashore to a South Seas island to fetch more water and discovers a young girl (Bessie Love) and an old man. Tom brings the two island dwellers aboard, where the girl experiences Nelson's cruelty first-hand. Tom and the girl escape, just as a menacing storm begins to form. Nelson reads the young girl's Bible and realizes the girl is his long-lost daughter by the woman who deserted him years before. He turns the ship around and tries to make a dramatic rescue before the storm's fury drowns the helpless couple.
