Content: Ray Liotta (Goodfellas) toplines this tense, brutal action thriller from director Waymon Boone. Tough military veteran Thomas Conrad (Joel Mathews) finishes a grueling tour-of-duty overseas and prepares to settle back into a quiet, happy domestic life with his family. A relentless drug enforcer (Emilio Rivera), however, soon turns up to throw a wrench into Thomas's plans. He kidnaps the ex-soldier, tortures him, and gives him an ultimatum at gunpoint: either assist with a cross-border drug smuggling operation, or watch his family meet a dire end. All is not lost, however: soon Navy SEAL Bruce Michaels (Ray Liotta) turns up to protect Thomas's loved ones; meanwhile, time is running out.
