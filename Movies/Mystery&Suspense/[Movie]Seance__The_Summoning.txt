Convinced that his friend has been faking her psychic abilities, Joey invites her and two others to hold a seance in the city morgue. The horrors of hell are unleashed, however, when the group mistakenly summons a demon that takes possession of Joey after he panics, and breaks the sacred circle protecting them all.
