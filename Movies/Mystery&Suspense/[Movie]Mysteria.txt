Content: Danny Glover, Martin Landau and Billy Zane topline this mind-bending {\thriller] from Swiss director Lucius Kuert. The premise concerns a down-on-his-luck Hollywood scribe struggling to finish his latest script under the burden of an impending deadline and a serious case of writer's block. He soon finds himself thrust into a situation wilder than any he has ever written about, as he becomes the chief suspect in a murder investigation involving the slaying of a politician's wife. These events then provide inspiration for his screenplay.
