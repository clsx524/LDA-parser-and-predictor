Content: A fractured gang of kidnappers are stalked by a mysterious creature while hiding out in an abandoned school as dissent grows amongst their ranks. It was the perfect crime -- abduct the daughter of a wealthy socialite, and simply lie low until the ransom is delivered. But as the criminals hole up in a derelict school and guilt sets in, a creature that emerges on the first day each spring to seek a sacrifice stalks the hallways in search of an offering. A.J. Bowen and Anessa Ramsey star.
