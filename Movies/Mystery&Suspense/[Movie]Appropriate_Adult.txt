Cast: 
Content: As originally aired on British television, this docudrama miniseries concerns Fred West (Dominic West), a notorious serial killer convicted for torturing, raping and murdering at least 11 young women and girls at his home in Gloucester, England, most of them between 1973-1979 - often in collusion with his wife Rosemary. The dramatic focus, here, is not the Wests' marital relationship per se, but Fred's interaction with Janet Leach (Emily Watson) , an "appropriate adult" assigned to assist him during his police interviews and formal charging. The film explores Fred 's perception of Janet as a confidante and a friend, and his disclosure o horrific facts to her, that she in turn uses to aid the investigation.
