Bigfoot is an American made-for-television film co-produced by AsylumSyfy. The film was directed by Bruce Davison who also stars as a local Sheriff. It premiered on TV on June 30, 2012 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 14, 2012. The film features a cameo by Alice Cooper playing himself.
When Bigfoot attacks an 80s themed rock concert in Deadwood, South Dakota, the cynical event organiser Harley Anderson (Danny Bonaduce) tries to kill the giant hairy beast and create a tourist attraction around its stuffed body. However, his former musical partner Simon Quint (Barry Williams), now an environmentalist, realises the creature is the last of its species, and is determined to make sure it does not become extinct. Sheriff Alvarez, played by Sherilyn Fenn, and her partner Henderson (Bruce Davison) try to call off an air strike after they spot Anderson and Quint on Mount Rushmore trying to trap the creature. Unfortunately, all three of them are killed in the process when attack helicopters fire missiles at them. Mayor Tom Gillis congratultes them for being heroes, and unveils a statue of them in their honor.
