Content: A small-time thief plots revenge after his wife is killed during a hold-up, and finds his tenuous grasp on reality fading as he struggles to care for their seven year old daughter. Criminal couple Arthur (Christopher J. Domig) and Monique (Valerie Monique Evering) pay their bills by committing low-level robberies and heists, with Monique handling the physical work due to Arthur's bad leg. But when Monique is killed by overzealous security guard Max (Danny Hoskins) while attempting to hold up a local bank, Arthur finds himself the sole guardian of their young daughter Maria (Zaira Crystal). Obsessed with seeing that Max pays for killing Monique, Arthur rents an apartment right above the one occupied by the security guard and his family, and bides his time waiting for the perfect moment to strike back. Meanwhile, Arthur slowly begins drifting into a state of delirium, which may or may not account for the ominous voices he hears plotting in the unoccupied apartment next door.
