Content: A weary ex-con finds his attempt to turn his back on his criminal past complicated when his former partner-in-crime's son blackmails him into conning a ruthless businessman out of $8 million. A lifetime ago, Foley (Samuel L. Jackson) was a grade-A grifter. But the con-artist lifestyle ultimately caught up with him, landing him a 25-year prison sentence. Upon his release, Foley believes he'll never be able to escape the shadow of his past. But that all starts to change when Foley meets Iris (Ruth Negga), a pretty girl with her own set of regrets, who sees a good man where many others see a lost cause. Meanwhile, just when it seems as if a happy future is finally within his reach, Foley is approached by Ethan (Luke Kirby), the son of his former criminal cohort, and an aspiring hustler who's eager to learn the lessons his father never taught him. Ethan's boss Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) is a self-made millionaire with a fierce reputation, but the ambitious young upstart sees him as the perfect target. With Foley's help, they'll earn a cool $8 million by pulling a classic con known as "The Samaritan." Initially, Foley rejects Ethan's offer. But Ethan isn't about to let the opportunity of a lifetime slip through his fingers, and soon the stakes are personal for Foley. Later, when everything starts to go wrong, Foley realizes that with more than his own fate hanging in the balance, he's got no choice but to do what he does best, and let the consequences be damned.
