Content: A twisted cremator and a teenage misfit strike up an unusual relationship in this independent thriller starring Brad Dourif. Fast approaching 60, Stan (Dourif) has few friends, and earns his living by offering budget cremation services out of his own home. But Stan has a dark secret; little do his neighbors realize, the outwardly frail recluse has taken to stuffing anyone he perceives to be a bully into the incinerator, and lately the fires have been burning particularly bright. Meanwhile, Stan finds a kindred soul in the form of Jarod (Jeremy Sumpter), a local adolescent from a broken family. For Jarod, getting pushed around is just another part of the daily routine - until he goes to work for Stan. Before long, Stan and Jarod are both working overtime to rid their small town of the rougher element. But when local detective Matt Fairchild (Scott Elrod) begins to suspect foul play, Stan must decide whether to make his young employee a full partner, or make sure that he's never heard from again.
