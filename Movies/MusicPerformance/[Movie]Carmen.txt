Carmen
Released Year: 1984
Running time: 155
Director: Francesco Rosi
Cast: 
Content: Georges Bizet's 1875 opera about Carmen, the colorful cigarette factory worker whose flirtations with the soldier Don Jose are forgotten in her love for the matador Escamillo, is the source for director Francesco Rosi's cinematic version of the same story. Placido Domingo sings the part of Don Jose, Julia Migenes-Johnson sings Carmen, and Ruggero Raimondi is Escamillo. Although there is nothing to fault in the singing itself, some viewers may feel that director Rosi has stayed closer to a stage production than the medium of film would warrant. Carmen received the 1984 Cesar award for "Best Sound."
