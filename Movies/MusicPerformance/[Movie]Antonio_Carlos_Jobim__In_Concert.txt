Content: Bossa Nova icon Antonio Carlos Jobim brings his upbeat brand of Brazilian music to the Los Angeles stage in a gala concert featuring a special appearance by superstar singer Gal Costa. It was with his own bold "Desafinado" that Jobim almost single-handedly launched the bossa frenzy back in the 1950s, and five decades later his music is still as vital as ever. Cello great Jacques Morelembaum and acclaimed percussionist Paulo Braga bring an ear pleasing texture to such timeless tunes as "Aguas de Marco", and a female vocal section comprised in part of Ana and Elizabeth Jobim and Paula Morelembaum make this a family affair that fans can't afford to miss.
