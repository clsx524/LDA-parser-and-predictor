Content: British pop-punk pioneers the Buzzcocks were reaching the end of their first era when then they played Hamburg, Germany on January 23, 1981 -- it would be one of the band's final shows before splitting up a few months later, and they wouldn't perform together again until staging a reunion tour in 1989. The Hamburg concert was videotaped for broadcast on the German pop music show Rockpalast, and Buzzcocks: Auf Wiedersehen features the gig in its entirety. The 17-song set includes the hits "Ever Fallen In Love?," " "What Do I Get?," "Everybody's Happy Nowadays," and "Boredom," as well as some rarely performed numbers from the group's final period, including "Airwaves Dream," "Why She's a Girl from the Chainstore," and "Strange Things"."
