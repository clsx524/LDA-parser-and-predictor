Content: The sci-fi-influenced guitarist Helios Creed founded the proto-metal band Chrome in the late seventies, comprised of himself, vocalist and drummer Damon Edge, guitarist John Lambdin and bass player Garry Spain; with its groundbreaking LP releases The Visitation (1977), Alien Soundtracks (1978), Half Machine Lip Moves (1979), Red Exposure (1980) and Blood on the Moon (1981), the group made music history by almost single-handedly inventing the industrial genre, prior to its disbandment in 1982; Creed later struck out on his own as a solo performer. The home video issue Chrome and Helios Creed: Dual Forces contains three original Chrome music videos from 1980-83 - "New Age," "Meet You in the Subway," and "Danger Zone" - as well as the unreleased music video for "Firebomb" and exclusive footage from the band's 1998 reunion tour. The program also features Helios Creed's music videos for "The Rant" and "Your Spaceman," and live footage from his 2006 Deep Blue Love Vacuum Tour. A bonus "timeline" documentary recounts the history of Creed - from inception through closure - and Helios as a solo musician.
