Content: Is Marilyn Manson a shock-rock visionary, a symbol of our troubled times, or just another rock star who came up with a good shtick? Marilyn Manson: Demystifying the Devil takes a close look at the controversial pop star's formative days, when the former Brian Warner was struggling to get the group then known as "Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids" off the ground in Florida. The film features interviews with several of Manson's former bandmates and associates (including his ex-girlfriend and the president of his first fan club), as well as rare performance footage and home movies of Manson and his pals exposing themselves, sniffing correction fluid, feeding a rabbit to a pet snake, and doing stuff with a toothbrush that you don't want to think about. This video features nudity and some sexual content and is not suitable for younger viewers.
