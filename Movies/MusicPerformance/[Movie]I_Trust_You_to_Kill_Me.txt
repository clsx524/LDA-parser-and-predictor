Content: Filmmaker Manu Boyer highlights the determined struggles of an unknown band to make a name for themselves as their curiously high-profile manager does his best to spread the good word in a musical documentary that is at once entertaining and surprisingly endearing. As Rocco Deluca and the Burden tirelessly tour through Dublin, London, and Berlin, their well-known road manager Kiefer Sutherland spares no expense in promoting both his best-loved musical act and his emerging new independent record label, Ironworks Music. Whether promoting the band in interviews or simply standing outside of the venue to offer free tickets to astonished passers-by, Sutherland sings the praises of Rocco Deluca and the Burden as the emerging band offers a vivid recollection of life on the road.
