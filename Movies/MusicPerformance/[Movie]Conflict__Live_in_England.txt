Content: Anarchic-minded punk rockers Conflict take their rowdy brand of rebellious hardcore on the road, and the cameras are rolling to catch two vintage live performances - one of which finds the band joined onstage by Steve Ignorant from hard-line radical rockers Crass. A performance at the Newcastle Riverside finds the politically-minded Thatcher critics tearing though a blistering stage set, while a second show captured live at Leeds during the band's U.K. tour proves the band's consistently maintained the high level of intensity that earned them acclaim from punk fans worldwide. Additional interviews, behind-the-scenes clips, bonus tracks, live clips, rehearsal footage, press clips, and photo galleries make this a worthy addition to the collection of any self-respecting punk fan.
