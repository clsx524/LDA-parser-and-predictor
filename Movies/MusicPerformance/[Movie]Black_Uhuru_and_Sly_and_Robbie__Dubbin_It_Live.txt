Content: Close out the Paleo Music Festival with dancehall revolutionaries Blach Uhuru and Sly & Robbie in this release of a concert captured live in Nyon, Switzerland in July of 2001. After changing the face of reggae forever in the '80s and '90s, Sly & Robbie have re-teamed with the band that launched their careers for a live performance that maintains the band's distinctively harder-edged sound and showcases such classic songs as "Party Next Door," "Bull in the Pen," "Solidarity," and "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."
