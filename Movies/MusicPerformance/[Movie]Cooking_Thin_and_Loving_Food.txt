Content: As the celebrator of weight loss through careful culinary preparation, celebrity chef Kathleen Daelemans speaks from personal experience. Once a size 22, at 205 pounds, she inadvertently signed up to become the chef of the Grand Wailea health spa in Hawaii. Understanding that her appearance wasn't exactly a banner ad for health-conscious cuisine, Daelemans slimmed down to a size eight, lost nearly 80 pounds, and virtually re-invented low-fat cooking by placing an exceptionally high emphasis on taste as she "slimmed down" her recipes. She has since become a well-publicized culinary expert, with her own weekly series on The Food Network and PBS, and a best-selling author of cookbooks. Daelemans' home-video special Cooking Thin and Loving Food takes weight-conscious viewers into the kitchen and teaches them, step-by-step, how to prepare a series of delicious low-fat recipes. It also features 20 recipes that can be printed out on a computer.
