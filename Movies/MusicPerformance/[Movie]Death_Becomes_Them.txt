Content: The Dan Lund-directed Death Becomes Them marks the latest entry in a long-held screen tradition - the shockumentary - which of course began with Jacopetti's notorious Mondo Cane and continued with entries such as Kirby Dick's Sick. Lund's film concerns Cathee Schultz and J.D. Healy, co-proprietors of the 'Museum of Death' in Los Angeles, which, during its shelf life, boasted artifacts and exhibits all related to the work of the Grim Reaper (coffins, autopsy implements, et cetera). Lund shot footage of the museum and its proprietors just before the institution's forced closure by building management, and also intercuts sequences in which an undertaker dances and sings musical numbers of songs original to this film. Fans of the outrageous and unusual will be hooked. Thematically, this makes an excellent companion piece to Thierry Zeno's 1979 docu Of the Dead.
