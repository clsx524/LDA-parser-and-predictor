Content: Tagged around the world with the moniker "The Countertop Guy," Douglas Smith has earned a deserved reputation as a pro at home remodeling and interior construction of counters. In the forty-five minute home video release Countertops 101: Kitchen and Bath Laminate Counter, Smith illustrates, on camera, the methods for cutting, building, completing the finishing work, and installing two variants of laminate countertop: the postform and square edge models. Useful for kitchens and bathrooms alike, Countertops 101 covers both the fundamental techniques of countertop building and the more complex instructions for final touches that give countertops a professional veneer.
