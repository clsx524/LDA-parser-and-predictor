Content: Fresh off the success of their latest full-length album Unraveled, progressive-oriented, North Carolina-based metal masters Confessor reunite to deliver a thunderous concert captured live in Oslo, Norway and featuring a nine-song set sure to brutalize the ears of the most devoted head-banger. In addition to offering earth-shaking renditions of such outrageously heavy tunes as "Prepare Yourself" and "Eve of Salvation", this release also offers exclusive studio footage, a music video for "Wigstand", interviews with the band, and a special "drum deconstruction" segment with Steve Shelton.
