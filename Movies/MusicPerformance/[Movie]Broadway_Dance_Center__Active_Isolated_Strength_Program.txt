Content: The at-home exercise program Broadway Dance Center: Active Isolated Strength Performance teaches and engages viewers in an unusual stretching process called 'Active Isolated Flexibility.' Each of the stretches is designed to target an individual muscle and will drain that muscle of toxins, thus alleviating tightness and shortening the process of bodily recovery that follows an intense workout. The overall effect is to increase the body's limberness, flexibility, and range of movement by transporting greater amounts of oxygen to individual muscles. Choreographer and fitness instructor Mich√®le Assaf hosts the individual routines and provides step-by-step instructions and on-camera demonstration. Also appearing are fitness experts Jim and Phil Warton, well-reputed for training five-star athletes and the directors of Wharton Performance, Inc., in New York City.
