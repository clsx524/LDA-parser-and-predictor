Content: Stu Cook and Doug "Cosmo" Clifford, original members of Creedence Clearwater Revival, host Creedence Clearwater Revival: Music in Review -- the first documentary to analyze the history, content, and impact of the John Fogerty-founded Southern band's music. From CCR's formation in 1967, to its self-titled 1968 EP (which spawned the hits "Suzy Q" and "I Put a Spell on You,") to its watershed mega-hit "Proud Mary" in 1969, and the handful of hit albums that surfaced through the end of 1970, this program examines the enduring impact that Creedence's lyrics and melodic innovation made on the American rock scene in the late '60s and early seventies.
