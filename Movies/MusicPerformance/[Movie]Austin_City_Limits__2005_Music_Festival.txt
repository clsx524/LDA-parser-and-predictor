Content: For music lovers who just can't seem to swing the trip to Texas to attend the landmark Austin City Limits Music Festival in person, the best of the fest comes home in a feature-packed release featuring performances from 25 groundbreaking artists. Though the centerpiece of the release is no doubt the energized performances of such bands as Jet, Bloc Party, Blues Traveler, Gov't Mule, Mike Doughty, and Widespread Panic, additional interviews and mini-documentaries ensure that fans watching at home have even greater access to many of their favorite artists than those who actually attended the festival in person.
