Content: Leonard Cohen is widely regarded as one of the finest and most influential poets and songwriters of his generation, a writer whose artful melange of love, eros, and despair has earned him a passionate international following and the respect and admiration of artists ranging from R.E.M. to Johnny Cash. In 2005, music producer Hal Wilner staged an all-star tribute concert in Australia in which a handful of major artists offered their interpretations of Cohen's songs, including Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, Rufus Wainwright, Beth Orton, Kate and Anna Mcgarrigle, and many more. Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man includes highlights from this concert and thoughts on Cohen and his work from the participants as well as an extensive interview with Leonard Cohen himself as he talks in detail about his life and his art. The film also includes a special performance of "Tower of Song," in which Cohen is accompanied by U2.
