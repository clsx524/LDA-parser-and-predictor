Director Curtis Burrell takes the reins for this earnest religious drama. It concerns a young woman who inadvertently comes face-to-face with the extent of her husband's cheating. Assisted by her housekeeper, she begins to uncover one scandalous secret after another - which tears the family apart. It soon becomes apparent that only God's mercy can draw them back together. ~ Nathan Southern, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 70&nbsp;mins
