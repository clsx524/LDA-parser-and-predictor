The film is the second in Sidney J. Furie's Vietnam War trilogy along with 1977's The Boys in Company C and 2006's The Veteran.
25 years since the Vietnam War ended, a group of American veterans return to Vietnam and meet up with TV journalist Kathleen Martin (played by Carre Otis), who is assigned to cover the reunion of the men from Echo Company. Soon, they are joined by their old Captain named Ramsey (played by Casper Van Dien), and they revisit the old battlefields they fought in and experience flashbacks of their time in the war during 1968.
The members of Echo Company, lead by rookie captain Ramsey (Casper Van Dien), experience a disastrous tragedy when several Marines are killed by friendly fire during an assault in Vietnam. Three decades later TV documentarian Kathleen Martin (Carre Otis) brings six of the survivors back to Vietnam to confront their issues and make peace with their former enemies -- but the enemy these days is Ramsey, whom they hold to blame for the deaths of their comrades. Via flashbacks and on-the-scene battle footage, the men come to realize a painful reality, one that results in new violence in the rice patties. ~ Buzz McClain, RoviSee All Under Heavy Fire Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 118&nbsp;mins
