Even by Monogram standards, Wings Over the Pacific is a modest effort. In his final film role, Montague Love plays WW I veteran Butler, who during WW II prefers to take an isolationist stance and squirrels himself away on a remote Pacific island. Alas, Butler's solitude is interrupted when American Naval aviator Allan (Edward Norris) and German fighter pilot Kurt (Henry Guttman) both land on the island. While Allan romances Butler's daughter Nona (Inez Cooper), Kurt, discovering that the island is rich with oil, tries to signal the Japanese fleet. Shaken out of his complacency, Butler is forced to take sides in the global conflict, with explosive results. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 61&nbsp;mins
