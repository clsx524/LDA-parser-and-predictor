Three months after the entire population of the planet was decimated by a highly-contagious zombie virus, a small band of soldiers and civilians have barricaded themselves in a remote military outpost in the U.K. countryside. Just when all hope seems lost, the group receives a signal from another fortified military installation claiming that there is sanctuary on the coast. But getting there won't be easy, because as soon as the message gets through, the legions of the living dead invade. With their resources dwindling and their spirits nearly broken, the few remaining survivors realize that their only hope is to fight their way to the coast, and never look back. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviSee All Zombie Diaries 2 Trailers and ClipsTheatrical Feature Running Time: 92&nbsp;mins
