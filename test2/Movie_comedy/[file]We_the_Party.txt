We the Party is a 2012 film written and directed by Mario Van Peebles. A revealing look at contemporary youth culture, We the Party shows teenagers as they are, not as adults would like them to be. We the Party is a comedy set in an ethnically diverse Los Angeles high school during the term of America's first black president. The film focuses on five friends as they deal with "romance, money, prom, college, sex, bullies, Facebook, fitting in, standing out, and finding themselves". We the Party captures the hopes, confusion, challenges and dreams of today's teenagers as they plunge headlong into an uncertain future.
Five Los Angeles teens contend with the trials of adolescence while racing to keep up with all of the latest trends in this honest look at modern youth culture from director Mario Van Peebles.
