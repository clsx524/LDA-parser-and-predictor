Dreams and disappointment bring two young people together in this independent drama. After being abandoned by his mother, seventeen-year-old Dilawar (Mohamad Imran Tapa) was taken in by his uncle Ali (Ali Mohammad Dar), a strict and unforgiving man who earns his living as a mason. Dilawar dreams of finding his mother and being reunited with her, but until that day he works as Ali's apprentice, having been forced to quit school and earn his keep. Dilawar wants to make enough money to move away, and he earns extra cash by doing homework for wealthy kids and though petty theft. One day Dilawar steals a purse from an attractive twenty-something woman named Bani (Taniya Khan) only to discover she works at a shipping company Ali does business with. Bani doesn't recognize Dilawar and the two strike up a friendship; he learns she's recently returned to India after receiving a degree in physics in the United States, and she wants to quit her job and return to America. Finding a kindred spirit, Dilawar brings Bani into his homework-for-hire business, although she doesn't realize the math and physics problems she helps him solve aren't his own homework. Zero Bridge was the first feature film from writer and director Tariq Tapa. ~ Mark Deming, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 97&nbsp;mins
