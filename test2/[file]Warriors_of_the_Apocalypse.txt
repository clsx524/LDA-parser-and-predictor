In the devastating aftermath of WWIII, a small group of female survivors use their brains, their martial arts skills, and a steady supply of heavy artillery to reach the city, and search for survivors. Fighting killer mutants and lone psychos along the way, the determined women soon discover that the city has fallen into the grip of ruthless tyrant Rollins (Debby D), and that she's dispatched a team of ruthless killers to exterminate all survivors. Now, the girls' only hope for escaping certain death and putting Rollins in her place is Harris - a former captive who has lost all fear of death, and seeks bloody revenge for the brutal slaughter of his family. As the Rollins' henchmen close in, the lethal ladies and their new companion prepare to fight for the very future of humanity. ~ Jason Buchanan, RoviTheatrical Feature Running Time: 91&nbsp;mins
